Namely that for the Tiered Seawall Wide, there is no option with stairs, and the same for the City Tiered Quay, again, no option with stairs. How are the people supposed to reach the lower levels on both of them? This would be okay if there were just pathways on the upper level for both, but there isn't, there's also the option for a pathway on the lower level. Now, for the Tiered Seawall Wide, you could use the Tiered Seawall with Stairs, but then you would have a large (and kind of ugly) gap between the two, as one is wide and the other isn't. However with the City Tiered Quay there is no option to get people to the lower level, as it is higher than the Tiered Seawall's lower level, but lower than the City Quay Wide with Stairs. This would at least be somewhat easier if you could at least line pathways up with the lower levels, but you can't do that (or at least I haven't figured it out). So why are these types missing? It seems like having options with stairs for these two would have been a pretty obvious thing to include.",

        "comment": "Referring back to that latest interview with Colossal Order CEO - Mariina Hallikainen - I would like to see what you think they may have in plans, not what your wishes are (we all know them, and they are various).So here is the interview thatdj97was kind enough to post a link to (interview in GameInformer -https://www.gameinformer.com/interv...ks-development-mod-community-and-six-years-of).Couple of take-outs:\"We had some serious SimCity fans in the dev team and wanted to achieve a spiritual successor to SimCity 4. Naturally, the ambition was much greater than our resources at the time, so we had to prioritize on the amount of content and different features.\" on starting development on Cities:Skylines and its inspiration.\"This was the dream from the start! (that's about current game - Cities:Skylines) We founded Colossal Order with the intent that one day \u201cColossal Cities\u201d would see the light of day. This was back in 2009 and we were five people with limited funding, so we decided to start with something smaller to build toward greater challenges. (...) I\u2019d say the most important learning from the CIM (Cities In Motion) games was getting to know the community and the meaning of modding for our games. We really see it as an integral part of the player experience we want to offer not only now but in the future.\"\"Our target at Colossal for copies sold was 300,000, so more than our previous games and enough to allow us to work on the game for a couple of expansions before starting something new. Now, six years later, it\u2019s still quite difficult to understand what actually happened, but we have been so happy to have kept it going so long.\" - they did quite a few millions of copies, didn't they? Is it over 5 or 6 millions now?On their biggest success:\"It has been absolutely fantastic, challenging, tiring, and yet always so rewarding to work on Cities: Skylines. I\u2019m a big believer in continuous improvement and it's at the core of our development process at Colossal Order. I think we all regret our failure to get proper seasons in the game, but it was simply not feasible at the time and we decided to live with the winter maps feature in the Snowfall expansion. The game has evolved immensely over the years with improvements and new content and features, but the absolute biggest success is our relationship with the community, our endless source for inspiration. \"And the very end of the interview:\"What does the future hold for Cities: Skylines? Do you have plans for a follow-up game, or are you looking to continue developing upon the existing base?Cities: Skylines, with its community, is the most important game Colossal Order has created. Beyond that, there isn\u2019t much further we can say at the moment.\"I think these are the most important bits telling us that something most important for companies is and should be - their customers, in C:S case, its community built around the game and the ability to adapt to different needs - they, as they said here (\"We focused on the very basic building blocks: roads, houses, jobs. City services to support the needs of the citizens: health, education, recreation. We wanted there to be as much freedom as possible, ability to create something from the real world.\"), gave us \"templates\", very basic staff to play with, manipulate and mod, so each one of us can enjoy the game in their way. And I think it's pretty safe to say, that's the experience many of us (if not all) were looking for and are enjoying it. CO obviously can see that and it looks like they want to provide that to us. For as long as they can.When creating C:S, after their Cities In Motions games, they had a bit of money, a lot more experience than when they started in 2009, and - I suppose - plenty of ideas. And I think that this game, C:S, was meant to be another stepping stone in their game development. To get some more room (especially financially) to create something even better later in future.Their target of 300 000 copies has been reached very quickly (was it few months or weeks?) and it's pretty safe to say - they have resources now, alongside the experience.Was it a tiny suggestion then, when dropping the name \u201cColossal Cities\u201d, and not just reference to the company name, that one day there would be \u201cColossal Cities\u201d? I remember a bit of a rumour at the end of 2019, when last DLC didn't turn up when expected (Sunset Harbour was delayed due to working on trolleybuses and plenty of issues they had with them), that they are working on something giving us much larger maps, to possibly build multi-cities on one map and have plenty of room to do that.Maybe, that's a possibility, and a very pleasant one.There was also news about a planned meeting between CO and major game community contributors, back in 2019, that I suppose took place and no one talks about its outcome - I could imagine that event as a meeting to exchange ideas, problems and issues with current game platform (which, as most of us experienced, is not very suitable for running even a small town with all DLCs on and no mods or workshop assets - which is not what CO would have wanted). What happened with it... well...I am getting the impression that, when they stopped issuing DLCs - nothing for over a year now - but they keep us engaged on their community channel and - I suppose it's CO doing it as well - organizing global build-off competitions, that is all to keep us with them for their next... I'd say product and game.Colossal Cities?Maybe.Although they were successful in replacing SimCity, there is always that limitation - not enough room to let your ideas run free across a map.But as at the same time the game community is very important to them (that's their life line enabling them their as well as ours dreams come true), I'm starting to believe tiny bit more (although it still sounds impossible) that if it is the next game that CO is working on and polishing for us (remember? they have money and time now) , maybe whole workshop and all those assets (I guess excluding mods) would be \"transferable\" to that new game too.\"Do you have plans for a follow-up game, or are you looking to continue developing upon the existing base?\"was the last question, and I'm sure they are very aware of it since years ago now. And do you think, they wouldn't splash few details on what they are working on if it was yet another DLC?\"Cities: Skylines, with its community, is the most important game Colossal Order has created. Beyond that, there isn\u2019t much further we can say at the moment\"was the answer, which screams a lot, although it's still just guessing.What are your thoughts on this interview?",

All other franchises, even within Paradox pool have a lot of dev diaries, what's next, all that stuff that keep the community active and the interest for the game rolling.Cities Skylines meanwhile get complete radio silence, we don't know if the game is abandoned at this point, if a sequel is in the works, if more DLCs are planned, nothing.I think the CEO at Colossal Order (Marina) should talk more with her publisher guys, because I don't think the dev team (CO) are happy knowing that their biggest game, where they spent years of hard work, the game that made their publisher\\owner a lot fo money, it's being threw in the garbage bin.Maybe you can try to Join SEGA, they really care about their PC strategy games and they costantly promote them with huge marketing campaigns and dev blogs about what's next.I am pretty sure SEGA would be happy to have Colossal Order along with Creative Assembly (Total War) and Amplitude studios (Endless legend), and they will probably give you more budget than what Paradox can do for next titles.",

Slopes would just gradually reveal the basement level and you can customize and build and design certain buildings yourself like a airport or a train station and one last thing,  It would be nice if all buildings to have a basement level, so buildings could be placed on slopes without needing a perfectly flat footprint.

That said, I would really appreciate some tips from other CS gamers on what I could do to improve my experience with the game. I've got about 1,242 hours invested in the game. It is my favorite game. That said, I have a major complaint:It seems to be a memory hog and a CPU crusher. Even an empty map in the Map Editor takes 5 minutes to load.I have a beast of a machine: 32 GB RAM, 5 ghz AMD 8-core CPU, 2080ti graphics card. That's why my post title facetiously mentions the Cray II supercomputer as a recommended hardware. I don't run any background utilities or other programs. Is Steam also hogging resources? CS is a jealous lover of RAM.One BIG complaint: you can be going along, doing whatever in CS, when you suddenly notice the game freezing up. Then you realize it's only the autosave function. Problem is, sometimes the game getspermanentlylocked up because you were laying down a road or whatever while it was \"packaging\" the work you were doing. Usually, the lockup turns into a hard shutdown (Ctrl-Alt-Del doesn't work) of the machine.I had to get this off my chest.

It's reasonable to suppose they want to improve the game, and the ideas are all to big and game breaking to just be DLC.What big new ideas would you like to see in CS2?  Do you agree the game vision / \"game pillars\" will be \"locked in\" soon? Personally I love the game as it stands, but it would definitely benefit from a twist or two - here's a few to get started -1. Place city development in an historical timeline. For example, have cities 'start' in 1945, right after WW2 as new green-fields cities, or from ruins of existing cities.  They might have existing monuments, buildings etc from prior centuries. This opens up many options eg Euro vs US vs elsewhere city types.2. Introduce a 'tech tree' and addstoryto the progression through utiltiies and transportation tech.  Allows for real transition challenge, from profitable fossil fuel city, to green city.  Link/limit the available tech/progress to the design focus, industry types and economic success (or otherwise) of the city.3. In same theme, how aboutarchitectural tech. New design techs in buildings of all zone types could evolve over time, ie suburbs/towns should look like the era they were designed in - until there's an \"urban renewal\".  Unless they are 'heritage protected'!4. Transportation - allow development of pedestrian/cycle access-only residential / commercial.  Maybe this is something that needs 'zoned roads' ie only allows commercial/industrial access.5. National government / world events and impact - focussed incentives like 'national freeway initiative', military bases, money for the arts, space centre.  These might need some way of ranking your city in various ways, with a \"political points\" system, ie not just funds?Thoughts?Inspired in part by:[edit] dammit I just realised another like minded soul already posted the topic.

Back then I was able to play for a little while without any issues at all.Now I have a relatively new PC build, and I want to spend some time playing this game, but it will crash my pc into a full restart whenever I play.This is just a vanilla build of the game, no mods or anything else installed.About a week ago it would crash after about 10 minutes of play, so I did some research and tried adding the -force-d3d9 into the launch options settings, and that seemed to fix it for a little bit, as I was able to play for about 20 minutes, and then saved and quit the game. But now it will crash within 5 seconds of the map loading. And by crash I mean that the entire PC just reboots, no errors or anything. That was making me think it was overheating, but I have downloaded speccy and I am watching the temps when it crashes, and the GPU is only at 45-50 deg, and the CPU is less than 40 deg.

It should be the platform closest to the building's road access (I will mark the problematic platform in screenshot).If I switch the line's stop from the outer platform to the inner platform, the line will work just fine. If I switch the stop to the other two platforms on the upper level, it will work fine too.The map I used is Desert Oasis. I cannot tell if this is in any way related, since I tried with some other maps and all platforms work fine (and I can't tell if they will always work). I created the first test city with Desert Oasis which reproduced this issue; then I created other test cities with Desert Oasis and there is no issue. Either way it's with the same set of mods. I also tried launching with -disableMods or -noWorkshop, but the issue persists.I suspected the placement/location of the Metro Plaza might impact it but I am probably wrong. If the issue exists in a particular save, it seems to persist no matter where the station is placed (even bulldozed and rebuilt in a different location, with lines deleted and redrawn). If the station works fine in a savegame, there should be no problem even if the station is placed in a location where I saw problems in another save.If you can work with the savegame I provided that would be great. The savegame should be able to load without any mods enabled. To test the savegame, you can try disconnecting the road between the residential area and the Metro Plaza, and/or deleting Bus Line 3. You should notice citizens take the bus/use their cars to travel to the commercial district or go to work, but they never take Metro Line 1 unless the stop is moved to a different platform. Nevertheless, Metro Line 2 works fine as long as you don't put the stop at the problematic platform.Can you replicate the issue? If yes, please explain how you did it.It's complicated. I first noticed the behavior on my main city (which is using Desert Oasis), then I created a couple test cities (not using Desert Oasis) and did not observe this issue. I created a test city with Desert Oasis and had the issue again, but that is the only time I am able to reproduce the issue. I did create other test cities with Desert Oasis and they all worked fine.AttachmentsFile(s) attached",

Moreover, I have also tried changing the resolution to 1080p whilst playing the game on my primary 1440p monitor, and noticed 0 difference, leading me to conclude that despite supposedly showing a 1440p image, the game is still actually showing the UI at 1080p, even when 1440p is selected in my settings (triple checked this) and when on a monitor of the appropriate resolution.I have even tried hooking my PC up to my 4K TV, and even then it manages to scale the UI correctly. It seems as if when on a 1080p and 4k screen (with the matching resolution selected) there are no issues, but the moment I go to 1440p on a 1440p screen, the UI appears to still be the same as a 1080p resolution. Screenshots are shown below. I recommend viewing them on atleast a 1440p monitor otherwise you will not be able to see the effect.This is a completely fresh CS install with no mods and no files left over from previous installs of the game. I have no issues with UI scaling to 1440p on any other game.Attached files include pictures of the main menu, as well as 2 ingame screencaps, one set for a selected 1440p, and another set for a selected 1080p resolution, all taken on my 1440p monitor, highlighting the fact that the UI appears unchanged, and is equally blurry regardless of selected resolution.Can you replicate the issue?

        "comment": "So assuming that there is a Cities: Skylines 2 in the works somewhere I thought it would be great to have community suggestions  and input into what form that it takes.  I've read somewhere that there is talk of introducing countries or something but that doesn't especially interest me.  It would be great if Colossal / Paradox setup some sort of user voice forum where people could submit suggestions and vote on them to help shape the new game.  If anyone knows of such a thing please let me know - I've not been able to find it.Barring that I thought I might use the forums here to at least submit some of my thoughts.  Now some of this might be included in mods available but  this is what I would like to see added to the base (un-modded) game.Roads/Network/TrafficEnable PROPER MERGING LANES like those you might find in real life, with various options for lane markings like you might find.Customisable road builder available in game, allow the creation of custom roads in game specifying number of lanes in each direction, with each lane being able to be of a different type sidewalk, car, bike, bus, tram and allow the addition of regular props along the way, trees, lights, signs, post boxes, seating.  Allow these to be created as presets that you can save to use in your city.Improved Traffic AI that lets cars change lanes anywhere and not just on nodes but also makes better use of multi-lane roads instead of queueing up in one lane the whole way.Allow trams to return without needing a roundabout!!!  In fact can you bring this into the current game also - this is ridiculous.Include some basic features from Traffic Manager mod such adding Give Way/Stop/Through, adding and removing stop lights and setting which lanes can turn or go straight (I know that you can add and remove stop lights and stop signs in game currently but the UI for that is awful).Include a net picker so piece of network on the map can be selected and then used to lay down more of that network.  (Yes I know there is a mod for this - build it into the game!  So handy.)Include a basic roundabout builder that can select the type of road to be used and size.  Roundabouts are fundamental and building them should be part of the base game.  Doesn't need all the bells and whistles of the mod as long as it can still be enhanced in a mod.InfrastructureAllow power networks to be created underground similar to water pipes.Remove the power zone created around structures and introduce overhead street power lines instead that can then be replaced with underground power networks  as a later unlock.  More like real life city planning considerations.Add data networks to the game so that internet cabling and 3G, 4G 5G towers can be added potentially onto existing building structures.  Make data networks improve happiness of people and efficiency of businesses.GraphicsImprove the graphics engine to allow even greater detail - Unreal Engine 5 anyone?The more the game looks like a real city the better!AssetsAllow assets to be stretchable to match (to a certain extent) the curve of the road.  This might leave the building unchanged but stretch the garden/outdoor (Fencing/hedges) area to stretch bed around the road, creating less gaps between assets, or allow all or part of a structure to flex a certain amount to the curve.  This would create more realistic blocks where there is no no-man's land like there is in the game now.Introduce the concept of seasons and allow Assets to have different appearances based on seasons, particularly trees & vegetation.  Maybe the option to have snow or not on other assets.Allow some assets particularly train stations to be placed without being connected to a road or to connect onto an existing train line instead!!!Currently if I want a station to line up to a rail network I need to guess where the rail bit of the station will be and create a road in about the right place to put the station then hope that the rail lines up nicely.Ability to have more rounded assets and structuresFind It mod built in.Ploppable RICO built in.TerraformingImprove the UI to smooth terrain, perhaps be able to paint an area and then have it smooth it out to the edges or surrounding roads.Allow placement of Trees and vegetation on steep slopesBe able to paint an area or brush with a combination of vegetation, select a mix of tree, plant or rock assets adjust the % of each and have the game randomly place these assets in the area in the desired concentrations.Paintable pavement and other surfaces that can optionally be bordered by roads or structures (rather than plopping down odd shapes to try and fit).  Have these surfaces be able to crop the vegetation underneath.  (I hate seeing the grass come through an outdoor pool asset - very annoying.)More tools to make more natural looking terrain like water courses and cliffs would be nice - I'm not sure how what exactly here, I just know that I find this a challenge.AudioAllow music to be pulled from playlists in Google Play Music or Spotify.  Allow the option to insert the in game adds in between these tracks through.I grow tired  of the ones in game and I find it somewhat objectionable to buy music packs that have a few more songs that I'm not that keen on either.MORE in game radio adverts!  These are awesome but there needs to be more!Can this be modded or become assets that the community can add into the game also?Other features:Asset and mod profiles - allow the game to be started up with different sets of mods and assets available as presets defined by the player to play the game in different styles.  Or make these presets shareable also in the community so that people can start with recommended packs from community members.Challenge mode - I really enjoyed the community challenges that Biffa put out for biggest city in 30 mins and worst traffic, it would be great if these challenges could somehow be defined and then posted out to the community to attempt with all the appropriate restrictions in place.EDIT: Almost forgot 81 tiles in the base game, & perhaps with option to go larger if resources permit.Anyhow I think there's a few other things that I've though about while playing the game that I've forgotten to include in here.  Mostly I just want more/better of the same game - not too dramatically different from the present game, if significant new features are added that take the game in a whole new direction then they need to be done as options so that the people who have come to love this game for what it is can continue to do so.Finally I would love to hear what others think of this list of mine and especially if you too would like to see a feature list / suggestions site that can take community votes on each feature like the Microsoft User Voice or other software companies use.What other features would you like to see that I have not thought of or included here?",

Especially camp grounds!On the topic of campgrounds. Cottages are also very common and do not always come with water or electricity but are still fine. I'd kill to be able to put some down without having to build septic and powerlines to them. Just like back home! Sure they wont be very valuable without those amenities but they still make do.Finally energy independent zones might be a later unlock but solar houses off the grid are a real thing and are becoming more common. Having a zone option to put solar on tons of roofs would be not only gorgeous from a birdseye view but also modern and realistic for rural areas.So i'd love to have a new zoning style for these.",

        "comment": "Recently, there are a few threads regarding a hypothetical successor of Cities: Skylines and our wishes. One thing that seems to be posted a lot is a new mechanic for building roads, so I thought we could discuss how a good road building tool would look like, how we can build the roads and paths we want.I posted this on another thread but I'm really interested in what other ideas there are:Have a modular system which allowscustomized lanes, decoration, footpaths. Allow to change the size of the footpaths. You could have a two-way road but with tram tracks just in one direction and trees on the other side or a one-way road with a bike lane etc. You could have parking spaces in between the bike lane and the rest of the road. Or a pedestrian area. Or a bike highway. And so on. You should have some templates and ready-to-use roads for beginners. Don't give us bike and foot paths as a separate system to roads. If you make a road just consisting of a footpath, you have: a footpath that snaps to your roads! You could have different styles (like gravel, dirt, asphalt, cobblestones, pavement etc.) for them, with lanes for vehicles these types could influence the possible speed. I would love be able toconnect footbridges/foot tunnelsover/under roads with bridges/tunnels to train platforms in a train station or to have stairs to footbridges or tunnels on the sidewalk (not just beside). In really dense areas this would give us much more possibilities for pedestrians. And can we haveescalators and elevators? What aboutwheelchair users, elderly and people with buggies, so you need to think about accessibility? There shouldn't be required gaps between roads and quays. Being able tobuild on quaysfrom the beginning would be great. We need the possibility to mark walk-able areas that connect to this new road/path system for squares, beaches or just walking in the forest. Or maybe cims could be able to walk just shorter routes over grass and create trails by constantly walking on the vegetation. A mod likeTM: PEshould be part of the game from the beginning. You should be able to build traffic-lights, zebra-crossings, ... outside road crossings. Oh, and we needferries for cars and passengers(eg. like in Norway) that really connect and can be used by services too so that bridges/tunnels aren't always required for smaller islands or wider waters.Click to expand...",

Examples of what new features could be: have neighbouring cities have their own needs, surpluses, goods production, unemployment issues, and so on.

        "comment": "Hello,I was searching for a more direct form of contact like an e-mail address, but I could not find. I hope my suggestion is well received by the community.At this point I believe many of you have already heard of Google Stadia and other similar cloud gaming services. They all have been growing and improving drastically over the past years. Now Stadia is expanding outside the US and is available here in Europe as well.Stadia has a free and a \"Pro\" tier plan. The free plan works like Steam where you buy games individually on their platform and you're free to play as you wish. The Pro plan includes 4K streaming and access to a library of selected games that you can claim and become part of your library forever as part of the plan, among other things.The beauty of using Stadia is how it adapts well to any situation you find yourself in. Sitting at your desk with a keyboard and mouse? No problem, kb&m controls you have, just like any other game. Wanna pickup your pad? Why not? Prefer to sit on the couch and play on the big screen? All you need is a Chromecast or a compatible smart TV (and a Stadia controller). Kids want to watch their favorite cartoon now? Well pause the game and move to your bedroom TV. At a friend's house without your laptop? All you need is your Google account and a browser!I've been out of the most recent titles as I don't feel like I want to invest on a powerful stationary desktop computer when I have already a perfectly functional new and incredibly mobile laptop I use for work which kicks ass at anything it does but only lacks the graphics card to play recent games, but draws immense amounts of power and heats up when it does, throttles the FPS when running on battery (for only 20 minutes or so at best), but i can comfortably stream at max FPS best quality on Stadia.Some of you will say Stadia is already dead and Google gave up on it, but that's not true. If you're seeing from outside and only sometimes see the tendentious news that's the impression you have, but when Google sold their gaming studio, that was the right move, they decided instead of creating their own in-house games (which let's face it probably they wouldn't be great) it would be better to use this money to invest on bringing in new publishers and improving the platform, and that is exactly what's been happening over the past few months. Stadia has been seeing active development and release of UI and performance improvements, new bigger games are coming such as Resident Evil 7 and the brand new Resident Evil Village are available and playing great in the platform.I believe Stadia is so great that I am comfortably using it alongside my Switch for other games as my main gaming platform, and I can comfortably say it is the future of non-professionally-competitive gaming as the PCMR e-sports players will definitely notice the inhuman added ~10ms of input latency.Having all that said, I believe Cities: Skylines and all other paradox Interactive games would find Stadia to be a great and comfortable new home, so I'd like to formally suggest Paradox Interactive to consider bringing them in to the new platform.",
