The game is very simple and plain in terms of graphics and enviromental objects such as pedestrians and things which could make the game more fun and enjoyable to play. \n\nIt would have been cool to have police chase your truck and give you a ticket, however police are present in the game, but they only flash their lights they dont say or do anything to you except the game gives you a vehicle crash penalty. The game is tediously boring to play it would have been nice to gain points for indicators and such and maybe have drivers design their own courses and deliveries there could have been so much more put into this game I found the game very limited in terms of play. \n\nI over looked all of this as I used the game to just practise driving around but then in the end the game became very buggy for me and whenever i reached 50 mph the steering wheel would flip to the other side which ultimately caused me to crash and damage my vehicle several times during gameplay. I would like to add that all the signs are wrong also some of the speed limits are like 90 and 100 mph which obviously you can not exceed greater than about 60 mph. I had to uninstall the game I wish I could get my money back but obviously i have played the game for too many hours :(",

It's a game about driving trucks around, and to a lot of people that's not going to sound like riveting gameplay. You should really give it a shot, though. This is a truly fantastic game.\n\nThere's sort of two sides to Euro Truck, both of which are really well-executed. On the one side, it's a driving sim - you just cruise the highways of Europe, night and day, rain or shine. It's peaceful, cathartic even. On the other hand, it's basically an RPG, with levels, unlockable upgrades, etc. For me, it presses all the same mental buttons as progression systems in a grindy JRPG do.\n\nYou really have no excuse not to give Euro Truck a shot. It's frequently on sale for under $10, and chances are high you'll end up having a bunch of fun. Two years on, the visuals are starting to show their age a bit, but that's really the only complaint to be made about this game.",

Since you can stream internet radio into the game, it's a great way to catch up on the news or listen to podcasts in a somewhat relaxing environment. Not having driven anything larger than a box truck, I can't say how accurate the simulation is, but I can say it's not realistic, simply because all the trucks feel the same. Upgrading the engine makes it accelerate faster, and there are a few different chassis configurations, but the feel is barely impacted.\n\nIf you come at this game expecting a \"king of the road\" experience, like the blurb claims, you'll be disappointed. Even if you did feel like king of the road, your subjects (the other cars) have no personality or purpose other than to serve as obstacles. The way to think of this game is as a sort of zen-like experience. Once you get on the highway, turn on your favourite radio or podcast, and begin to relax, you'll see why I've spent over 100 hours pretending to drive shipments of toys around fake Europe.",

        "review": "After driving an impressive 98'000km in game. Being a veteran trucker adds more fun to the game as you begin to understand the fundementals of it all and you become a better player at completing missions and getting out of tricky situations.\nThe only bad point that needs mentioning: I have found myself, more than once, stuck at a highway intersection (Under a bridge) with nowhere to go due to traffic lodged up from all directions and not being able to move at all. I had to carefully squeeze between the vehicles and the hill, knocking over a roadsign, just to get out of there. The only problem was that I had to do a U-Turn on a tight road, with a long trailer, to be able to get on the correct on-ramp and that caused some damage to the truck and trailer.\n\nOther that that, everything feels real. You feel the difference when you're without a trailer and when you're with trailers of different types and wheight causing different driving techniques. Some trailers allow aggresive driving while others don't. You even have the option to hire drivers that bring you extra income while they drive missions for your ever expanding business.\n\nIn short, it's a great game for anybody who loves driving and loves a good simulation. Missions of all types allow you to do a short mission if you don't have plenty time or save in the middle of a long mission and come back to it at a later stage. The autosave function also comes in handy in case there's suddenly a power cut. True story XD",

Or when re-entering a highway, sometimes AI cars will just stop, and even when they have enough time, they won't step on the gas and get going. Waited for them to get going sometimes almost 2mins, they should get going when they hear me using the horn! :D\nThe map could use some more improvements, better exits on some gas stations (no acceleration lane), for example.\nThe GPS could talk your way around, with a sweet female voice, preferably. :-)\nActually seeing the drivers hands on the wheel, using the parking brake, turn lights, gears, that'd be awesome and add a lot more life to the cabin view.",

The 'tycoon' aspect of this game is very good and I hope for the next version that they expand upon it by possibly letting you hire & manage mechanics, dispatchers, etc.  To improve the simulation aspects I would suggest adding insurance and drivers license consequences for accidents, make accidents visually realistic (visible damage) and more catastrophic.  To further improve the immersion more diverse weather is needed (where's the snow in the mountains?), and consider improvements to the wear & tear mechanisms as well.  To expand on the arcade aspect of the game, adding police who pull you over rather than just auto-tickets would go a long way but also adding some sort of bidding-for-jobs against competitors or a race aspect (bonuses for early delivery?) would be fantastic.\n\nThe driving aspect of the game is good and can be challenging, however if you are looking for a simulator then Euro Truck Simulator may not be the game you want.  The scenery in this game is gorgeous, and if you like working toward expansion goals you will enjoy hiring & managing drivers, buying garages and trucks, and building skills.  \n",

I have mostly good things to say about this simulator and I recommend it, especially if you have a steering wheel.\n\nEdit: I have now gone over to play this in VR with Oculus Rift S and I must say that I enjoy the game even more now because of the immersion. I also notice so many things about the environment and the other traffic that I didn't see before when I was looking straight ahead. There are lots of details actually, but they are easy to miss on a flat screen. Now it looks as if I'm inside the truck and really driving it. I used to wish for an eyetracker or something to be able to turn my head, but I must say that there is no way to be more immersed than to move over to VR. Although VR headsets could use a bump in pixel density because when looking in the distance it kind of looks like you are playing Minecraft, but if you are looking not so far ahead it's just so nice.",

The graphics and cabin detail is wonderful, and this is one of those few simulation games that actually have true physics that are realistic. You feel the weight, the power, the size and the essence of your truck and the cargo you carry. SCS software have gone above and beyond to create the ultimate truck driving simulator - going as far as adding a radio function that works wonderfully. Little to no bugs and the free roam features make this game even better.\nI cannot recommend this game enough if you enjoy driving simulators, and it's even better with a wheel, pedals and gearshifter (H-shifter is nice). \nI'm sort of being picky with this, but the only thing I can see which can be added to the game is Steam Cloud support. Because nothing is more annoying than gaining 118 hours of game time only to move computer and loose all of that. Plus, Steam doesn't always seem to push the updates like it should do. But again, I'm just being picky. \n11/10.",

The other thing is even if you are at 100% damage your truck shows no wear what so ever, I am not saying to make it into a crash simulator, just to at least make the truck look dented. Other than those two things the game is very fun, if you are looking for gameplay this is not the game for you. This game is for people who want to relax and enjoy the scenery, not race or something like that. ETS2 is fun in a way that doesn\u2019t make sense it is just overall enjoyable.

        "review": "[h1]Rating: Recommended[/h1]\n\n[h1]Premise and gameplay[/h1]\nEuro Truck Simulator 2 casts you as an up-and-coming truck driver in Europe. You start out doing freelance jobs for other companies who provide you with a truck for each job, eventually amassing enough money to buy your own garage and truck, which is when the game truly begins. Of course, you can always take out a bank loan, but if you want to stay debt-free, you have to work for that money. You can always take a quick job if you feel like it, but to gain access to the most powerful trucks you need to buy and upgrade them yourself, both visually and performance-wise.\nAfter each job you will gain money, experience and truck upgrades. Experience can be used to level up your driver in various ways. For instance, you can put points into certifications for dangerous cargo or long distance driving to unlock more job types or eco-driving to reduce fuel consumption and the resulting costs.\nOnce you've got your truck company off the ground you can start expanding by buying more trucks, hiring drivers and more garages across Europe. The game doesn't offer much in the way of micro-managing you employees, but you can upgrade their trucks in the same way you upgrade your own and decide what attribute they should focus on levelling up.\nDo note that there's no win-state in this game. It just keeps going while you expand your freight empire and if you want a clear goal you need to set it yourself.\n\nWhen you're ready to hit the road you either pick from a list of available quick jobs or go the the freight market to find cargo to haul with your own truck. Quick jobs are great if you just want a quick fix, as you don't have to drive all the way to pick up your cargo. If you want the pure experience you buy a truck, pick a job and drive to pick up the trailer before embarking on your journey. Along the way you will need to follow the rules of the road and watch out for traffic. Any and all traffic offences will result in a fine, which can severely bite into your profits if you're not careful. While you can get away with speeding, there are speed cameras along most roads that you need to be on the lookout for. You also need to keep an eye on your gas tank and your sleepiness levels and pull into a gas station or rest stop when needed. When you arrive at your destination you can choose to park your truck yourself, which can be a true challenge in certain locations, or relinquish a handful of experience points by using auto-park.\n\nOne immersion breaker is that there is no real in-game economy to speak of. Everything stays pretty much static no matter what happens in the game and there are no realistic cargo chains (i.e. raw materials to factory, products to store). This will hopefully likely in the near future as the developer has created tools for creating such chains and has implemented a few in the Scandinavia DLC.\n\n[h1]Presentation[/h1]\nSince I'm so late in writing this review, I'm lucky enough to write it after the 1.17 patch was released. This patch brought plenty of changes to the graphical presentation, most importantly the lighting. The game is definitely no Project CARS, but it has absolutely been serviceable and is now even more so with the improved rendering engine. Some scenes are made absolutely gorgeous by it. World textures could definitely use some upgrades to make the game a look bit more realistic and some models look a bit basic, but overall the visuals of the game are just fine. Not mind-blowing, but they do the job well.\n\nThe trucks themselves are modelled in stunning detail, and the Mercedes-Benz New Actros that was released in patch 1.18 takes this to a whole new level. It's clear that a lot of love and hard labour has gone into the trucks and they are definitely the highlight of the game's presentation. The only downside to the models is that the switches and knobs inside the cabin aren't adjustable. I may have been spoiled by other pure simulators, but it would be a nice touch if you could actually use the physical buttons instead of mapped keys on a keyboard or controller.\n\nThe physics simulation leave a little more to be desired. The truck cabins don't sway as much as they ought, which is especially noticeable during roundabouts or when decelerating. Trailers don't [i]feel[/i] heavy, but just slow you down, and there's very little feedback from the road surface.\n\nThe sound design as a whole is serviceable. The truck sounds are of course very good, but the rest of the sound scape doesn't feel as fleshed out. Not that it matters all that much when you spend most of your time inside the cabin (which [i]is[/i] the proper way to play), but it would be nice to have a some more prominent ambient sounds to instil a sense of place when you pull over and turn off the engine. If the truck sounds or road noise aren't to your liking, there are loads of mods available that remedy this.\n\nThe world design is generally pretty good. Areas like Great Britain and Switzerland feature some of the best roads and vistas the game has to offer, but some areas feel very bland, especially Germany, which unfortunately is the country you travel through the most because of its location. These areas have generic roads with generic intersections and generic city layouts. It all starts to feel very same-y when you pass the same copy-pasted intersection for the fifth time on a single haul. Some off/on-ramps are also very confusing, where one lane suddenly turns off the road without any heads-up. The signs don't always indicate correctly and these intersections are unrealistically common in the game.\nThe DLC that has been released is a lot better in this regard, but if you want to up the fidelity of the base game, there are a lot of map mods to try. ProMods is one of the bigger mods that add new areas to the game, but they are also currently in the process of redesigning a lot of the base game to get it up to scratch with the new areas.\n\nThe game also supports TrackIR and Oculus, but I haven't had any chance to try these features out.\n\n[h1]Controls[/h1]\nThe game supports keyboard & mouse, gamepads and steering wheels.\nThe controls for kb&m and gamepads are fairly straight-forward and work just fine. The wheels are way more interesting and you get a lot of settings to perfect your experience. Earlier, the trucks had some wonky wheel rotation properties, but a recent patch gave all trucks 900\u00ba rotation. I haven't found any settings I feel are missing, either. There are multiple sliders for different axes and FFB settings, all buttons are rebindable and there is a useful wizard for quick setup.\nThe force feedback feels a bit \"grindy\", though. I use a Logitech G27 and it feels like the engines struggle with providing resistance, almost like they're slipping on sand. This does not happen in other games, where the feedback is tight and grippy. I have no idea what causes this, and it doesn't seem like any of the settings fix it. It [i]works[/i] and can give you a juicy jolt if you crash, but it's not what I've come to expect from force feedback.\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\nDespite some technical flaws this is one of my favorite games. It's a solid package and great for a relaxing evening of driving.\nIf you can stomach long drives, gradual progression and being responsible for your own fun [strike]in an open world[/strike] on the open road, this game comes highly recommended.\n\nI rate this game:\n[strike]Essential[/strike]\n[b]Recommended[/b]\n[strike]Conditionally recommended[/strike]\n[strike]Not recommended[/strike]\n[strike]Avoid[/strike]",

        "review": "While I cannot offer a review of this game, I can offer my favorite recipe for beef wellington. Enjoy!\n\nFor the Duxelles:\nTo make the Duxelles: Add mushrooms, shallots, garlic, and thyme to a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. Add butter and olive oil to a large saute pan and set over medium heat. Add the shallot and mushroom mixture and saute for 8 to 10 minutes until most of the liquid has evaporated. Season with salt and pepper and set aside to cool.\nFor the Beef:\nTo prepare the beef: Tie the tenderloin in 4 places so it holds its cylindrical shape while cooking. Drizzle with olive oil, then season with salt and pepper and sear all over, including the ends, in a hot, heavy-based skillet lightly coated with olive oil - about 2 to 3 minutes. Meanwhile set out your prosciutto on a sheet of plastic wrap (plastic needs to be about a foot and a half in length so you can wrap and tie the roast up in it) on top of your cutting board. Shingle the prosciutto so it forms a rectangle that is big enough to encompass the entire filet of beef. Using a rubber spatula cover evenly with a thin layer of duxelles. Season the surface of the duxelles with salt and pepper and sprinkle with fresh thyme leaves. When the beef is seared, remove from heat, cut off twine and smear lightly all over with Dijon mustard. Allow to cool slightly, then roll up in the duxelles covered prosciutto using the plastic wrap to tie it up nice and tight. Tuck in the ends of the prosciutto as you roll to completely encompass the beef. Roll it up tightly in plastic wrap and twist the ends to seal it completely and hold it in a nice log shape. Set in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to ensure it maintains its shape.\nPreheat oven to 425 degrees F.\nOn a lightly floured surface, roll the puff pastry out to about a 1/4-inch thickness. Depending on the size of your sheets you may have to overlap 2 sheets and press them together. Remove beef from refrigerator and cut off plastic. Set the beef in the center of the pastry and fold over the longer sides, brushing with egg wash to seal. Trim ends if necessary then brush with egg wash and fold over to completely seal the beef - saving ends to use as a decoration on top if desired. Top with coarse sea salt. Place the beef seam side down on a baking sheet.\nBrush the top of the pastry with egg wash then make a couple of slits in the top of the pastry using the tip of a paring knife \u2014 this creates vents that will allow the steam to escape when cooking. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes until pastry is golden brown and beef registers 125 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Remove from oven and rest before cutting into thick slices. Garnish with minced chives, and serve with Green Peppercorn Sauce, Roasted Fingerling Potatoes with Fresh Herbs and Garlic, and Warm Wilted Winter Greens.\nGreen Peppercorn Sauce:\nAdd olive oil to pan after removing beef. Add shallots, garlic, and thyme; saute for 1 to 2 minutes, then, off heat, add brandy and flambe using a long kitchen match. After flame dies down, return to the heat, add stock and reduce by about half. Strain out solids, then add 2 cups cream and mustard. Reduce by half again, then shut off heat and add green peppercorns.\nRoasted Fingerling Potatoes with Fresh Herbs and Garlic:\nPreheat oven to 500 degrees F and place a baking sheet inside to heat.\nAdd potatoes, rosemary, sage, thyme, and garlic to a medium bowl. Drizzle with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Remove sheet pan from oven, lightly coat with olive oil, and pour potatoes onto pan. Place potatoes in oven and reduce heat to 425 degrees F. Roast for 20 minutes, or until crispy on outside and tender on inside.\nWarm Wilted Winter Greens:\nCook honey and balsamic together over medium-high heat in a large saute pan, about 5 minutes. Toast walnuts in a small skillet; set aside to cool.\nPile greens on a platter. Stir mustard into balsamic-honey dressing, then whisk in about 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil; pour over greens. Season greens with salt and pepper and garnish with walnuts, pomegranate seeds, shavings of Parmesan, and shallot.",

It doesn't have good perspective program on the device. Either it shows the way too far or to close.\n- sometime AI vehicles behaves dull.

It can disturb your attention. Best if you use a controller and wheel together.\n- There are no green light with arrows indicating direction you can go. All of the crossing has full green.

There is something very Zen about just driving along the countryside, with your lead foot and the beautiful landscapes around you. If you've ever travelled Europe by rail or car, this game can be a very nostalgic and dramatic experience.\n\nMy only complaint is that sometimes the game \"lurches\" -- that is, when you are driving at a constant speed, the truck periodically slows down and then catches up again. During the lurches, the framerate does not seem to drop, so it seems that something else is causing it to bottleneck. I'm playing on a GTX 980 with a 3Ghz i5 CPU and 8Gb RAM, so I doubt my system is to blame. At any rate, the lurching doesn't occur constantly and it doesn't really detract from the driving experience, but I still hope that it gets sorted out in a future update.",

        "review": "First off, I highly recommend this game. Provided you also get he following DLC, High Power Cargo Pack and Going East Expansion. The first adds new cargo and trailers that are both more rewarding and heavier than the original cargo variety. The second adds a large new section of map to drive, and many more cities and countries. Both are well worth the added cost. The other DLC's available consists of custom paint jobs. They add nothing to the gameplay, but you can buy those if you like them.\n\n\nAbout the game;\nYou are a truck driver in Europe. You select what city you want to base your future company in, and start out working for companies delivering cargo with their trucks. You gain experience with each load that is safely delivered without doing too much damage. You can choose to buy your own truck as soon as you save enough money, or by getting a loan from the bank. If you own your own truck, you can upgrade or customize it however you choose (once you obtain the experience levels to unlock the upgrades wanted). You earn more money if you own your truck vs. driving a company's truck. As you get more money and discover various cities, you can buy additional garages and hire drivers to work for you... increasing your income. You will have to buy a truck for each new driver, and upgrade your garages to gain space for more drivers.  Garages come in 2 sizes. Small has space for 3 drivers and costs $180,000  A small garage can be upgraded to a large garage for an additional $100,000. A large garage also has a fuel pump for your benefit.\n\nWhile the game is a good game, it is not without certain shortcomings.\nFirst, There are many features that SCS had the code for from prior releases in the series that could have been included but were not. In Hard Trucks wipers had 2 speeds, now they only have 1. In Extreme Trucking, you had a variety of weather and road conditions, from ice and snow, to dirt roads and steep terrain. Here, the weather is very simple... it is either not raining, or its raining. Roads are all paved and quite uneventful. Hills are gradual, and the roads are formed from a set pattern of road sections that have been copied and repeated over and over. \nAnother omission is that much of the available upgrades do absolutely nothing.  Most trucks offer 3 different truck cabs. A standard cab w/ no sleeper, a standard cab w/ sleeper, and a larger cab with a bigger sleeper. None of the cabs affect the trucks fuel economy, handling, or performance. The addition of a sleeper does not enable you to rest anywhere that a non-sleeper truck can. It's all purely cosmetic. Same for the transmissions. Al trucks come with a 12 speed transmission regardless of engine. Upgrading to the other 12 speed transmission does nothing for the performance or fuel economy. Tires are another thing, no matter what tires you choose, the handling, performance, fuel economy and wear are the same. All pure cosmetics. Adding a front bumper or guard does nothing to increase the durability of the truck. the AI traffic pays no attention to the existance of the roof mounted safety strobe lamps, nor is there and aerodynamic penalty for the wind drag from a roof mounted light bar full of lights and horns. Horns are ignored by traffic as well. Both horns and roof safety strobe lamps are purely there for cosmetics.\nThe AI traffic has it's own issues. They will change lanes suddenly, stop suddenly, crash into you, and cause traffic jams lasting over an hour. They also are prone to hauling ass... I've been running 102 mph and been passed and couldn't keep up with traffic cars before in 50 mph zones.\nA big issue relates to the drivers you hire and the trucks they drive. It does not make one bit of difference if you buy the cheapest truck you can get (a $97,000 Man for example), or buy the most tricked out, most powerful, most expensive truck (A fully decked out Scania or Volvo costing $275,000+)... you earn the same. Upgrading their trucks does not speed them up, enable them to haul heavier loads, or make them happy... It doesn't do anything. Save your money and give each driver hte cheapest basic truck you can buy. You also cannot see the other trucks on the road, nor in the garages, ever. They only exist as a small thumbnail picture in the manager section.\n\nThings I'd like to see in future updates:\nMore weather types... Snow and Ice, hail, fog, etc...\nMore variety in roads, Steep hills and switchbacks, narrow roads with high dropoffs and no guardrails. Dirt, gravel and pothole filled bumpy roads. Roads with deep ruts.\nFunctional tires that have varying grip depending on terrain and weather. Make better tires last longer or have better traction than cheap tires.\nAdjust the engine outputs and trailer load weights so that pulling a 55,000lb trailer with the entry level engine is nearly impossible... making having a more powerful engine something you both need and desire. Adjust fuel economy so that the more powerful the engine, the worse your mileage (currently, there is no difference)\nMake upgrading trucks for your driver have a benefit.\nMake traffic AI react to safety hazard strobes (stay back a safe distance, give way when turning, etc...) as well as move over when possible if you blow the horn at them.\nMake truck cab differences matter. If no sleeper, you stay only in a Hotel or at your upgraded garage. If a small sleeper, you can rest at gas stations and rest areas, but you have to rest longer to get a full 11 hrs driving time.

Its great! I like the traffic, I like the roads, I like the feel of spending money on new truck! Finding well priced job on the market is exciting, leveling driver feels rewarding, upgreating your truck feels like Christmas shopping. All of that is great... but now the cons. Economy part of the game is pure arcade. I understand it, common player don't have 3 years to expand his company, so all need to be speeded up. But it still feel crazy getting 30+ euros per km. Game got only main roads on the map, so don't be surprised seeing closed road due to accident and having additional 100-200km to drive when taking alternatives. And it happens often. So often, that I start to ignoring it! Road closed on every 2nd or 3rd job? Just ignore the police and try to drive closed road anyway, usually it's possible and you'll not be fined for that! Not possible? Go wrong way on motorway, its only 100 euros fine! You'll be fined 1000+ euros for +7km speeding so who cares?!? Fines are additional story here. Sometimes I fell like it's not simulator but educational game for 10 years old. No police, no cameras, but you'll still get ticket. For speeding, for red lights (and yellow is red, if you don't believe me, try it), for collisions. Maybe it's possible in Norway, when due the police absence old vikings gods takes action, but in Poland for example? We can drive here +10km/ph in front of police and they will not even blink they eyes. Cameras will take the picture when you're +20km/ph over. Too many paperwork and no profits for fines under 20km/ph. 99% lights don't have cameras, so where this tickets came from?!? So what you're doing? You keep ignoring it as well. When you got 20k+ euros per job, who cares about 2-3k of fines? Take the limitation of your truck, if you're fined for +6-7km/ph, why not drive 130km/ph+ on your important jobs, make it 40 tons racing game! But you know what? It breaks the immerse and all the realism is gone. Fix this stupid fines for everything, this basically not happening in real life! Lower the amount of closed roads or add all the network and let me go back on motorway next entrance. Then it will be really great driving simulator. I'm too old, having too many kilometers on the road to educate me, just let me drive like in real life. That the simulator is for!\nI'm very curious about your opinion",

They were ok but lacked somthing in my opinion. SCS have really nailed it with ETS2 by bringing the managment side into the game. I very much like transport managment and driving games and this combines the two. SCS have announced American Truck Simulator, I hope they keep the managment mode and build on it. Maybe more in depth managment, maybe competiors? With the release of WOT Alpha maybe they can add a multiplayer aspect where your freinds can join your company as drivers vise versa. That would be incredible. \n\nAnother great feature is the internet radio built in. Listen to live music from across Europe :D\n\nAnyway fantastic game.

The game engine shows its age with mediocre lighting, low draw distance and noticeable pop-in, no matter how much you crank up the settings. Also in some places you will get FPS dips and stutters (even on a high-end pc). But, to be fair, since its first release, ETS 2 had come a long way and reached a level where it's entertaining and varied enough to make you wanna ignore its shortcomings and keep coming back to it. And it's slowly getting better with each map expansion.",

        "review": "Truck game? I don't even like truck in real life and I always hate it when i got stuck behind one in a one lane road. So I tried the demo of this game to see whats all the hubbub is about. And from being annoyed by truck, this game helps me to form respect and appreciation toward truck driver and somehow annoyed at myself as i see myself in the AI behaviour in game. Like \"WHY THE HECK ARE YOU SLOWING DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD NOW I NEED TO GEAR DOWN AND BUILD UP AGAIN ALL THOSE LOST MOMENTUM YOU PIECE OF...\" now i drive my car and react properly with trucks on the road. So i bought the game and the journey begins...\n\nIt is a very relaxing game that I always fired up during weekend nights. But it also can be challenging at times like hauling the oversize cargo with steerable axle and then trying to reverse park it in one go. Some of the good points about the game that I can think of:-\n\n-The map is huge and it's getting bigger every year.\n-New trucks and tuning packs are introduced every now and then.\n-New trailer and challenges are introduced as well (heavy cargo, high power cargo, double trailer, and soon to come special cargo)\n-Mods:-\n+Huge list of mods with multiplayer mod stands out at the top (TruckersMP). You get to have a delivery convoy with your friends or stranger and witness some funny stuff on the road. And it's fun to chat using the CB radio or using other 3rd party voice chat app like ts or discord. I've also joined virtual trucking company and make deliveries based on requirement of a virtual company. If you like role-playing, TruckersMP mod really offer that part in this area. \n+Map mods is just unbelievable and the attention to details in some of the map mods is just astonishing (ProMods, RusMap, TSM, Eldorado... to name a few).  I've driven in snowy region of Iceland and desert of North Africa. \n+Truck Mod and trailer Mod. The truck that you want to drive isn't in vanilla game? chances are there is a mod that allow you to use that model of truck out there. My fave is Volvo VNL with Baobab tree trailer climbing mountain of Eldorado Map mod.\n+Truck skin and trailer skin, company name and skin, gas station brand name and fuel price. All these are mod-able that it helps in immersion. \n-Constant update and development of the game. You can tell that they really love the game and that's all I need from a developer.\n\nAnd that's only what i can think on top of my head. I'm sure there are a lot more points that I haven't mentioned.\n\nBut like any other game, there are things that can be improved such as:- (in my opinion)\n\n- the graphic. The graphic is still limited to what DirectX 9 can offer. I'd imagine that having this upgraded will tremendously improve the quality of the game in term of graphic and performance. \n- the ability to own your own trailer and pick up cargo from factory and deliver it. There is still no option for this yet.\n- damage system and physics. The damage system is still pretty basic, like if i get into an accident, when i go to service station i can see what the percentage of damage for different part of the truck. I completely fixed the engine and transmission. I ignored the cabin and wheel damage. After leaving the service station, my truck engine died with message \"engine malfunction\" when i know it's completely fixed. It's just the tire and cabin that is still damaged. So it kinda defeat the purpose of having option on what to repair at the service station... oh and it would be nice to have visual effect of a damaged truck. Like my cabin is 100% damaged but in game, it looks brand new and shiny all the time.\n- attention to detail. For example it would be nice if we can interact with the interior of the truck like pushing button on the GPS nav, radio, roll down the window, go out of the truck to attach/detach the trailer. And also, there is still no cable connection between the trailer and truck even though the wires and cable is hanging behind the truck, I guess they are connected via wifi?... \n\nwell these are just my opinion. Whatever it is I'm still enjoying the game with my friends. :)\n\n\n\nUpdate - much of the im provement has been met. and lots of development. good job scs and modding community.",
