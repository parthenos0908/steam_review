I can spend many hours just following a bus, a ped or watching a responding police car's dashcam (with a mod for dashcams.) Even if that doesn't interest you, just building a city and maintaining traffic, public transportation and your budget will entertain you for hours on end. The only thing I find annoying is that cyclists cycle on the footpath if there's no cycle lanes.",

Turns out that is only on first run/boot of game.\n\nThe creation progress for someone new to the game is frustrating, especially because starter road and other stuff is locked for the duration of the tutorial. Which makes it hard to prethink and prepare you city for a grand scale-able increase, so the bulldozer is there and wil be used too often. and that will waste precious starter money. Especially since Building can be a pain, first I had trouble bending road before I knew of the bend button, the tutorial didn't help there.\nThe tutorial also didn't warn me that you need plenty of space for electrical towers and I vaguely rememeber the last time I played having trouble with the irrigation system which also it doesn't prep you for.\n\nLastly some of the UI could need a bit of brushing up. When you select left sided driving or right it can get confusing if it's on or off. This game will frustrate you and possibly reload a dozen times. But for the patient and steadfast, this could be a quite enjoyable simulation.\n\nI am recommending this game because I like creative games like this and I do want to spend some time getting to know the in's and out's of this game.",

        "review": "The city-builder genre hasn't seen a lot of action since SimCity went south. Cities: Skylines might finally be the key to reviving it after its premature death.\n\nIt's basically what SimCity could have been in the modern day: a simple, straightforward city-management sim allowing for road construction, zoning, power and water management, etc., but with the addition of 3D visuals and no forced grid-snapping. It's also a lot easier than SimCity, with cities not going bankrupt in an hour or dying due to a 30-second interruption in water service while you relocate a water pump.\n\n\nGOOD:\n\n- Intuitive, straightforward controls - Cities: Skylines plays like a simplified SimCity, which is nice for someone like me who was daunted by how complex those games could get.\n- Freedom from the tyranny of the grid! Finally, we can have curved roads and non-perpendicular intersections.\n- A pleasing 3D visual style - you can freely look around your city from any angle you like, and it looks very nice, even up close.\n- MUCH easier than SimCity - in SimCity, I could barely keep a city going until it hit 2,000 citizens before going bankrupt. Cities: Skylines makes it much, MUCH easier to make money, so your cities will last longer and lose that feeling of \"this game is only about playing until you inevitably lose.\"\n- The game is clear about when you've done something good/bad, but isn't pushy about problems in your city. Citizens will sometimes compliment your efforts in the Not-Twitter(TM) news feed when you install a new park or wind turbine, and they might give an occasional \"I like this city!\" shoutout, or they might complain lightly about noise, garbage, etc., but beyond that the game doesn't nag you about things. It feels good not to be pushed around about city problems and to get a kind word every now and then to know you're doing something right.\n- A strong sense of progression - you can watch your city's buildings grow as they upgrade to larger structures, and population milestones unlock new buildings and services. You can actually see your city growing rather than just watching a population counter slowly tick up.\n- High customizability - you can create your own maps and import custom models and textures for buildings. The Steam Workshop makes it easy to acquire and share custom assets.\n\nBAD:\n\n- Weird camera behaviors - the standard camera is a bit limited in its movement, which changes as you zoom in/out, and it rests on top of buildings if it runs into them. It can be confusing at first.\n- The depth of field prevents me from seeing my city streets clearly, even when zoomed in. I don't want to turn it off because it looks nice otherwise, but I'd like to know how to adjust it.\n- The lack of a grid has a downside - placing roads is a bit awkward due to a lack of snapping options, so your city can quickly grow unwieldy if you aren't planning it out carefully from the get-go.\n- Unclear interface elements - the demands for industrial zones and office zones are shown by a single bar, making it very difficult to tell which one is actually desired. I zoned a bunch of area for industry only to have the bar remain the same and watch half my industrial area become abandoned. Zoning for offices finally reduced the bar.\n- #Way, #way, #WAAAAY ##too ####many ######of #########these. The in-game Not-Twitter(TM) announcement system is grating to read through sometimes.\n- The Not-Twitter(TM) feed posts the same few generic messages every few minutes. It's annoying to have repeat messages popping up all the time.\n\n\nHighly recommended if you liked the classic SimCity games and wish they hadn't gone south the way they did. It's nice to see a city builder that not only attempts to revive the beloved SimCity formula, but endeavors to improve upon it.",

Neither does Sim City 2/3/4.\n\nAlmost everything you might want in this game is either covered by the mostly must-have DLCs or the tenthousands of mods and assets.\n\nThis leaves me basically with the biggest issue that this game has: I wish there were seasonal changes. It's the only gripe I have.\n\nStunning and eye-opening for its time, these days, the mods make it what it is.\n\nVanilla is functional for a few hours, but you'll soon want around half of the DLCs, and 10+ gameplay mods - imho, the devs should pick up all the no-brainer ones (like traffic manager and such) and incorporate / bundle / pay the mod devs for their work - because honestly, I wouldn't want to play this game on console or vanilla anymore.\n\n-\n\nWhat I'd wish for the eventual successor to have:\n\n-Seasons and seasonal events\n-Several distinct international styles, maybe picked on a globe, which could also influence seasonal day-night cycle durations and how harsh or little the season changes are. (still with the option to have a 'china town' aka themed districts, but it'd be a lot more intuitive to go by globe, esp for the season / weather part)\n-map-local weather - rain here, sunshine there, snow in the higher regions, fog elsewhere, etc.\n-A rethinking of the disasters - they're way too devastating and punishing - I wouldn't mind them if they wouldn't mean I'd have to rebuild the overly detailed whole areas they ruin, desperately having to try to remember how they were and how they did function, or give it up and have to come to gripes with that I'll have to build anew over them. Long story short, I switched off disasters and I would not recommend spending money on that DLC in this game. Next game needs to do that better.\n-As said above, just incorporate the top 20 of must-have mods of this one directly into the next game from the get-go.\n\n-\n\nI don't want yet another Transport Tycoon clone / reskin. Those games are great on their own accord, but here I want to build a city / region, and with all the DLC and like 50+ mods, this here is near perfect. Round that up to perfect, and it'd be the best game ever.\n\n-\n\nOh and yeah, I upgraded my PC to an otherwise overbuilt monster for just this game. You might have to do that, too.\n\nBasically, have at least 8 CPU cores, and as much RAM (16 GB is a min req if you ask me) and V-RAM as you can afford. Especially if you want a lot of asset mods.",

Since you are given a very large map to create any city you want with, the amount of creativity possible is endless.\n\nThis game has about ten DLCs that do not come with the base game.  I only have one of the DLCs (Mass Transit, at the time of writing), and I feel that I want only a little bit from each of the packs: fishing from Sunset Harbor, Trams from Snowfall, new offices from Green Cities, and so forth.  But, at over a hundred dollars for all of them, the price to value ratio is just too high for me personally.\n\nThis game recently received a free update, which gave us several new features that I love: above ground metros, eldercare, and childcare, to name a few.  With the release of a new DLC comes a free update, which makes the game better each time.  \n\nI feel that Cities Skylines is a game that you can easily get hundreds of hours of enjoyable gameplay from, due to the almost endless creativity.  If you like management, creativity, and strategy, this game is for you.\n\nMy only complaint is that it takes skill to lay roads that make your city look good.  It's easy to lay grids, but they get old, and curly suburbs are hard to get right.\n\nIn any case, would definitely recommend.",

There has never been a city builder, So detailed, and so utterly massive and influential since the release of this game. I do not believe there is a way to top this masterpiece. That said, there are still multiple things I wish the developers would release as expansions. \n\nOne, a major water physics update. Cities Skylines Dynamic water, maybe the very thing that made it famous, and while texture packs exist, there is still much that could be done to improve it. \n\nTwo, Natural Disasters. The inclusion of this brought much fun, but it still felt like there could have been more. Volcanoes for example, with lava that cools over time, or perhaps whirlpools like in Simcity 3000 Unlimited, a game that EA has not re-released last i checked. With Dynamic water, the effects would be amazing. Ice Storms, which force the city to have to thaw itself with special polocies, these things could be improved. \n\nThree, Man Made Disasters. Everyone knows these can happen, in real cities either from poor planning or negligence, Cities skylines is limited in this category. It would be fun if there were more types of pollution, even radiation. And have way for us to experiment in figuring out work arounds or major clean up operations. Toxic pools, or even a scenario where we are given a toxic wasteland and must make a city out of it, and clean it up. These challenges would bring a new competition to the growth of the game. \n\nFour. Maybe perhaps this a bad idea, you can say so below, I have no problem with it. But on a personal note, I would love to open dialog with the developers, Because this is the game I had wanted since i first played SimCity, and now, I want to ensure that all future games that expand the city building genre meet the requirements and expectations of this game. Thank You so Much Paradox Games. \n\nYou have not ceased in my mind to Wow. \nYou keep me in Awe. \nThank you.",

With all the mods and assets (for free, by the way) on Workshop for this game, the DLC's are not at all necessary.  I've been playing this game for years now (2,496 hours at the time of this review) and have never been bored once.  And the only DLC I ever bought was AFTER DARK \u2026. only because it gave me bicycle lanes.  I've felt no desire to purchase the Disasters or the Mass Transit DLCs, even if they were dropped to $1.00 each \u2026.. okay, maybe the Mass Transit one if only $1.00.\n  \nBut I've gotten off-track of my point, which is that with all the mods and assets that are free for this game, you don't really need the DLCs.\n\nIf you just subscribe (it's free) to the First Person Mod by Tony56a, you can have days and weeks of fun just traveling around in your city.  As a Cim yourself or just riding along in a vehicle or a Cim wherever they go.  The game is COMPLETEY DIFFERENT \u2013 and sooo much fun \u2013 once you jump down into it and actually look at it from ground level.\n\nFrustrated with creating a city?  Don't bother to create one --- on the Workshop, you can subscribe to a city of your choice (again, for free) that is already all set up for you, mods and assets, roads, city services, and all, and immediately start playing about down in the city as a CIM yourself.  Or you can start from there (with all the frustrating work of setting things up) already done for you.  From that point you can play with what you subscribed to or start adding in or removing anything you like from the city.\n\nAnyone who hasn't tried this game is cheating himself/herself of one of the most fascinating experiences ever \u2026. and I gotta tell ya, NO ONE could get me to play ANY computer games before I was forced by a family member to sit down in front of this one for one hour and play it.  Now I'm hooked and spend almost all my spare winter season hours on it  \u2026  and, to my shame, some of my summer gardening hours as well.\n\nAnd, honestly, for a vacation into a world you can make into your very own, the initial price is more than worth it.

Even without natural resources I can get easily a positive bank balance and never really worry about it again.\n3. With natural resources after a couple of hours I had $15m\n4. As long as buildings are covered by services there's not much else to worry about.\n5. Traffic management is usually the biggest part of the game, ensuring that key buildings e.g Train cargo stations can service the 10,000 trucks that visit daily\n6. Traffic is also pretty bad, on a 4-6 lane 1 way all of the trucks will stay to the first lane 75% of the time (mods can somewhat fix this though)\n7.

The only suggestion I have for developers is that they consider increasing some of the building limits for people with systems that can support it.  My very first major city that I started and I actually hit both the building limit and the node (Streets) limit.  Granted, the city was huge, but it limited it on adding a new building or adding a new sidewalk/path to my already huge city.  I understand the reason for the limits, but I think now that the game is several years old and computer CPU and GPU have advanced even further, it's time to expand on those limits a little more.  \nBut all in all, I absolutely love this game.",

I feel myself on the brink of existential angst as I find that their is little to no reason to do anything in this game. Reaching milestones in game are nearly pointless as special, and overpriced, \u201ccosmetic\u201d building are unlocked to spruce up your towns. Gameplay becomes tedious late game, if you can call it a late game, as you constantly place roads and zone areas again and again and again. The only thing that happens that \u201cspikes\u201d the difficulty is when you run out of room to place roads and zones, and that challenge is overcome by buying more endless dead space so that you can place more districts and roads. People state that this game is a joy in the modding department, and that if you just let loose and mix things up by applying your own flare and creativity to city planning that this game just seems to open up. But despite all this I find the game to be a chore, a grindy and unrewarding chore. The faults of the game are further emphasized by the dlc direction that Paradox has decided to take with Cities skylines. Pointless and paradoxical (no pun intended) dlc\u2019s are released for this game to include a radio show, snow maps, and concerts. Sounds good on paper, but snow maps are unique to themselves and add little to nothing to the base game. The radio show that adds tracks to ingame music can be circumvented by simply turning in-game music off and streaming music on your pc\u2019s background. And concerts\u2026.. Who the fuck asked for concerts, It's a single building that is much the same as any other overpriced single building cosmetic that you would place in your city, it accomplishes nothing provides superficial depth to a game that deserves better. No, instead of making dlc\u2019s that would add to the base game and give further depth to a game that desperately needs it we get cosmetics and content packs that cater to exclusive, limited, and casual gameplay mechanics. Idk what they are smoking over at Paradox Interactive, they are literally sitting on a gold mine in my opinion. Can it be said generally that they game is \u201cgood\u201d possibly, but i think if you\u2019re being truly critical with this game it is \u201cok\u201d at best and is easily forgettable which is a shame because if the game had gone in a different direction it could have been truly great.",

I tried to find a fix for the glitch and to my dismay it appears that ones has been widely known since 2016 (death waves) and the other appears to have been known about since at least 2018 (based on Reddit). The second glitch is the garbage trucks, police officers, and hearses just refusing to spawn. I tried not using 1-way roads to fix it as others have had success with  that. However, it still occurs, my city goes broke, and game-over. For the death waves glitch there is a mod that successfully fixes it. I tried the mod before writing this review to see if that works and it does. As for the city services not spawning to patrol for crime, pickup garbage, put out fires, etc. I have no idea how to fix that. I did read that it is an AI issue that occurs with larger cities and that checks out since it only happens once my city gets to around 300,000 people. Still, no point in playing if you aren't going to go big.",

        "review": "Its a decent game but the content feels very limited without the expansions. The controls are good. The graphics are demanding and its an okay-ish game.\n\nSo many simple features would add greatly to this game. I miss the feature that SIM city had that you could trade with neighbouring cities based on requirements. I wish you could export garbage or import power etc. It would add a new dynamic. Right now its basically a huge traffic manager simulator. The twitter bird is super annoying and you get the same 10 messages endlessly which makes it really stupid and obviously unfinished somehow.\n\nSim city had more varied and random petitions from the citizens about things like shuttle services, legalising gambling, various policies etc. Here they have very few policy options tucked away in the menu that you can use. But it feels so unsatisfactory. \n\nYou feel a huge disconnect from the citizens in your city. Not for one second do you ever feel involved or like they're real people in your city. Its good but after a few hours, the repetition in everything really gets jarring and annoying. The expansions and mods add some content but still overall it feels inadequate.\n\nThe worst part is the obvious bug that it seems like they don't intend to fix. Its the death waves. Every few years you have a sudden death wave where about 1/3rd of your city randomly just dies. The deathcare system is overwhelmed, and the city is full of corpses. Land values fall, buildings get abandoned and its an overall PITA. \n\nThey justify this bug by claiming you need to stagger residential zoning but this theory makes no sense. New residential properties are not exclusively populated by infants of the same age who live in the  same spot all their lives, grow old and then suddenly die all together. It is absurd but after running into my third death wave and having a massive number of crematoriums spare that I turn off except during the death waves, I realised that this was complete nonsense. Oh and you need to manually click and demolish every abandoned building...\n\nOverall I enjoyed the traffic management and the mass transit DLC and some mods that added in new buildings.

After having new and better mods being built and better game play, This game is a huge step up from SimCity. The engine is much stronger and the Graphics are HD compared to others and the depth of game play is there. It is power hungry so you may need a beefy $1K computer. Having daily new player content is nice and I recently downloaded Night Life DLC to keep adding on. Really fun and easy to kill a few hours of your day or find yourself seeing the sunrise in the morning. Great City Sim and just a nice game.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Nov 26 2016 - ARG Publications\u2122\n\nUPDATE>>>\n\nSo CS, not a whole lot has changed from last review. CS continues to update and fix some performance issues and now I can get about 30K Citizens with 40FPS. DLC's & UGC's are nice and add more game play. Can tell that CS may be starting to slow down on progression and feels like they may be moving to a CS2? I wish that they would offer a way to integrate more HyperThreading to unlock more CPU power. Maybe a setting that is like Simple RIG (1 Core / 2GB Ram)  / Mid Rig (2 Core / 4GB Ram)  / Extreme RIG (4Core+ / 8GB Ram). That could be a programming nightmare i dont know...

        "review": "I played this game, then played it, played it some more. Stopped for a while, got the university DLC, then played more. This is a beautiful, complex, deeply layered, and wonderful game. The prebuilt maps are all fun, and the world builder editor opens up limitless possibilities for new playgrounds. The cities feel alive and evolving, and it's so satisfying to watch your zones fill in. I personally have the most fun building and managing the roads and traffic flows. The music is chill too honestly. \nSmall things that would improve the game for me\n-Buying more land tiles on a map\n-Does anyone have an issue getting hydroelectric dams to work properly?\n-Building road/train connections to outside the map, instead of just having whatever you start with\n\nOverall an absolutely wonderful game!",
