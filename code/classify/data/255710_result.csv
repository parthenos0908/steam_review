1. I want to place something keeps spamming error only thing I can do is close the game.
2. The game by itself is boring so after 1 play session you want to have dlc or mods (You need mods for a lot of basic things but they are shit to setup and error commonly).
3. It has a bad optimization it sometimes crashes and has a lot of lag spikes.
4. The glitches make the game sometimes unplayable."

The official solution:
ÅgThe solution is (for the time being) to uninstall Citrix Workspace as this will enable you to run the game/s as normal again. (Åc)Åh

Game is great, unfortunately, for some weird reason, there is a bug that prevents this game from running if you have Citrix Workspace installed. This is a work-related tool, so the proposed solution to uninstall Citrix is obviously not an option for me. There are some Ågwork aroundsÅh but they either require weird installation of Citrix that needs the IT departments permission to install, or require the force use of opengl driver, but this also causes some issues with menu interactions & occasionally black screens.

Supposedly this is due to Unity engine bug that got patched in 2018Åc.

Weird bug, but I cannot recommend the game until they properly fix this.

I tried to find a fix for the glitch and to my dismay it appears that ones has been widely known since 2016 (death waves) and the other appears to have been known about since at least 2018 (based on Reddit). The second glitch is the garbage trucks, police officers, and hearses just refusing to spawn. I tried not using 1-way roads to fix it as others have had success with  that. However, it still occurs, my city goes broke, and game-over. For the death waves glitch there is a mod that successfully fixes it. I tried the mod before writing this review to see if that works and it does. As for the city services not spawning to patrol for crime, pickup garbage, put out fires, etc. I have no idea how to fix that. I did read that it is an AI issue that occurs with larger cities and that checks out since it only happens once my city gets to around 300,000 people.

But after several hours of honeymoon you start being bothered by bugs that prevents you from going deeper. For example there is a widely reported persistent bug that after you build multiple clinics/hospitals they may stop sending out ambulances, leaving your citizens to die. The game also isn't good at explaining how things work. After several wordy text walls in the beginning, later unlocked functionalities are not explained well. The developers keep publishing new DLS's with hefty price tags without fixing these critical issues is just unacceptable."
0,0,1,1,"good game

*except for the stupid death wave bug*

psa, if you notice a lot of people start dying very quickly you are probably encountering this bug. If your citizens start dying and your death services cannot recover the bodies quickly enough (this could be due to a lack of deathcare facilities but is more than likely a traffic issue) then citizens living near the dead body will eventually get sick, die, make more dead bodies, cycle repeats... eventually your entire city population will be down about 80%

0,1,1,1,"Ill advised to play without the Green Cities Expansion and the Parks Expansions adds a (unrealistically) profitable metagame from planning for and building rewarding parksÅc once these two expansions existed the game met the requirements I need for a city builder to replace Sim City 4.

Green cities... solves that nasty water pollution problem so that you can actually not pollute water thus not be forced to pump all rivers (if any) bone-dry if one does not, drinking water to be polluted.


If one could in-game build road configuration templates designed for above/below ground junctures, then that would be ideal... this game seems to require some tact even when attempting such a template in the template editor... and such templates refuse to work in-game as the terrain is never flatÅc wish it had an augmentation that would give some play in how the roads paste in rather than having to craft every above/below ground junctionÅc 

Parks, well, it pained me not to be able to make use of otherwise dead-space that buildings can't properly utilize if you do not do a grid layoutÅc I want to be able to have triangular sliver buildings, L shaped buildings that wrap around other buildings, buildings built above or at least with skybridges above (unburied) roads.

Mass transit, maybe I make roads too efficient as out of 80,000 only ~2,000 ride it despite the entire city being hooked up with a stop on various lines every 2-4 blocks.

What is my air pollution at with all these cars? No really, what is it? It cannot be nothing.

The last thing I would want in a city builder is something that gives it life past After Dark, which a city really needsÅc

Let me drive, fly, locomote around my city... maybe throw some missions in with that that have cultural references or challenges that perhaps unlock things or give temporary buffs/debuffs to the city? Simply city building can get boring, especially when despite dead body collection/destruction is all the way to the right on the green bar and yet people are moving out because there are dead bodies everywhere and the crematoriums and graveyards just can't keep up... despite being spread throughout the city and traffic flow is in the green for all but a very small subsection due to an overbuilt road infrastructure... that makes no sense, must be a bug (part of original review, unfortunately lost that city as there were no cloud saves at the time and the game (at least used to) do(es) a poor job of storing itÅfs saves on disk)."
0,1,1,1,"Its a decent game but the content feels very limited without the expansions. The controls are good. The graphics are demanding and its an okay-ish game.

So many simple features would add greatly to this game. I miss the feature that SIM city had that you could trade with neighbouring cities based on requirements. I wish you could export garbage or import power etc. It would add a new dynamic. Right now its basically a huge traffic manager simulator. The twitter bird is super annoying and you get the same 10 messages endlessly which makes it really stupid and obviously unfinished somehow.

Sim city had more varied and random petitions from the citizens about things like shuttle services, legalising gambling, various policies etc. Here they have very few policy options tucked away in the menu that you can use. But it feels so unsatisfactory. 

You feel a huge disconnect from the citizens in your city. Not for one second do you ever feel involved or like they're real people in your city. Its good but after a few hours, the repetition in everything really gets jarring and annoying. The expansions and mods add some content but still overall it feels inadequate.

The worst part is the obvious bug that it seems like they don't intend to fix. Its the death waves. Every few years you have a sudden death wave where about 1/3rd of your city randomly just dies. The deathcare system is overwhelmed, and the city is full of corpses. Land values fall, buildings get abandoned and its an overall PITA. 

They justify this bug by claiming you need to stagger residential zoning but this theory makes no sense. New residential properties are not exclusively populated by infants of the same age who live in the  same spot all their lives, grow old and then suddenly die all together. It is absurd but after running into my third death wave and having a massive number of crematoriums spare that I turn off except during the death waves, I realised that this was complete nonsense. Oh and you need to manually click and demolish every abandoned building...

Overall I enjoyed the traffic management and the mass transit DLC and some mods that added in new buildings. Somehow the game has such excellent ratings on Steam that I do not believe accurately represent the game's shortcomings. I'm kind of on the fence and would ordinarily give a neutral rating. The game got boring fairly quick and I do not really recommend it as a good city builder unless it is more involving and has more content. OR unless they fix the deathwave bug."
0,2,2,2,i just started playing again and i love it but for some reason it crashes
0,2,2,2,"Certainly one of the best City-Building Simulations out there! I typically play these types of games on my MacBook when I want to lounge around, and relax. It's just that type of thing I do. This game used to have some texture, and lag-issues on my Macbook, but since it's updates it's not as bad. I mostly play this on my PC now anymore, except for ""Project-Zomboid"".

The Pros to this game.

Great AMOUNT of DLC (even though I don't own them all yet)

There is many different strategy's that you can go by to get your City the way you want it

Easy to use interface

And so much more I could say about this game. Everything about it so far is simply amazing, and I am excited to see what is to come of City Skylines!

The Cons:

If you do decide to play this on a Mac... I would wait a little while till they sort out most of these issues. It's not as bad as it was before, and no... It doesn't ""lag"" anymore really. It just has this issue where it ""freaks out"" when I move the mouse around and start to get things started and built.

 I would set most (if not) all of your settings to Medium 

MY Macbook Specs: 

RAM: 16GB
Processor: 2.8GHz Intel Core i7
Running the current macOS, and I still have issues. It's the only game ported to the Mac that's given me these types of issues so far! 

"
1,0,0,0,"There has been lots of crashes. I hope by buying a new laptop maybe this issue will go away. Seems to happen with a city of about 100k population. I had limited hard drive space. Used cloud for saving the games. Still no fix. Love the game otherwise.   The airport only allows use of one gate. it should operate more like a real airport.  Roads are still an issue that vehicles favor the right lanes the most and traffic jams are common do to the lack of full use of all lanes.  Lots of bugs.  Seems there is lots of mods which are great but, the functions noted above need to be realistic."
1,0,1,2,"Great game if you want to play it casually.

Kind of horrible if you want to mod it and build a really specific and detailed city. It's a pain in the ass to constantly look for which mod is causing one specific error message that spams you and makes the game unplayable, terraforming is really weird and does not make sense, you need mods to be able to freely place a lot of objects and roads.

I hope that the developers are looking at the modding community and taking notes. IF they're working on a new game, I really hope that they put in more modularity and that they will make terraforming and detailing much simpler. I guess this game was in the beginning not really intended to be played this way."
1,0,2,1,"The points I liked is the level of attention to detail I have seen during my last play. 
The availability of a steam workshop. +++
The balance between simulation and design +++

The bad?
From my experience,
The game now is locking up in several repeating loading screens and the dis-ability to play your game offline.
This game is bloatware to me. Turns out that is only on first run/boot of game.

The creation progress for someone new to the game is frustrating, especially because starter road and other stuff is locked for the duration of the tutorial. Which makes it hard to prethink and prepare you city for a grand scale-able increase, so the bulldozer is there and wil be used too often. and that will waste precious starter money. Especially since Building can be a pain, first I had trouble bending road before I knew of the bend button, the tutorial didn't help there.
The tutorial also didn't warn me that you need plenty of space for electrical towers and I vaguely rememeber the last time I played having trouble with the irrigation system which also it doesn't prep you for.

Lastly some of the UI could need a bit of brushing up. When you select left sided driving or right it can get confusing if it's on or off. This game will frustrate you and possibly reload a dozen times. But for the patient and steadfast, this could be a quite enjoyable simulation.

I am recommending this game because I like creative games like this and I do want to spend some time getting to know the in's and out's of this game."
1,1,1,1,"Still to this day the only good modern town planner, if you ask me. TT clones don't count for this. Neither does Sim City 2/3/4.

Almost everything you might want in this game is either covered by the mostly must-have DLCs or the tenthousands of mods and assets.

This leaves me basically with the biggest issue that this game has: I wish there were seasonal changes. It's the only gripe I have.

Stunning and eye-opening for its time, these days, the mods make it what it is.

Vanilla is functional for a few hours, but you'll soon want around half of the DLCs, and 10+ gameplay mods - imho, the devs should pick up all the no-brainer ones (like traffic manager and such) and incorporate / bundle / pay the mod devs for their work - because honestly, I wouldn't want to play this game on console or vanilla anymore.

-

What I'd wish for the eventual successor to have:

-Seasons and seasonal events
-Several distinct international styles, maybe picked on a globe, which could also influence seasonal day-night cycle durations and how harsh or little the season changes are. (still with the option to have a 'china town' aka themed districts, but it'd be a lot more intuitive to go by globe, esp for the season / weather part)
-map-local weather - rain here, sunshine there, snow in the higher regions, fog elsewhere, etc.
-A rethinking of the disasters - they're way too devastating and punishing - I wouldn't mind them if they wouldn't mean I'd have to rebuild the overly detailed whole areas they ruin, desperately having to try to remember how they were and how they did function, or give it up and have to come to gripes with that I'll have to build anew over them. Long story short, I switched off disasters and I would not recommend spending money on that DLC in this game. Next game needs to do that better.
-As said above, just incorporate the top 20 of must-have mods of this one directly into the next game from the get-go.

-

I don't want yet another Transport Tycoon clone / reskin. Those games are great on their own accord, but here I want to build a city / region, and with all the DLC and like 50+ mods, this here is near perfect. Round that up to perfect, and it'd be the best game ever.

-

Oh and yeah, I upgraded my PC to an otherwise overbuilt monster for just this game. You might have to do that, too.

Basically, have at least 8 CPU cores, and as much RAM (16 GB is a min req if you ask me) and V-RAM as you can afford. Especially if you want a lot of asset mods."
1,1,1,1,"This is a good city building game , it will suck you in and your free time will be eaten up, with that said there are a couple of things that need to be addressed by the devs that has not been "" fixed"" since the game came out , these are my "" pet peeves "" of the game , 1: There is no way of adding trees in block form , you have to add them one at a time , time consuming. 2: The highways need to be one Single Expressway with 4-6 lanes in each direction instead of putting 2 expressways ,one in each direction. 3: you should be able to control how many "" outside town trains"" to have , this gets very conjested very quick and is anoying . 4: Traffic also gets conjested like the outer city trains , would be nice to have a traffic flow system , there is a mod for this on the work shop , but i could not get it to work . Like i said above , this will eat up your time. Go get it ."
1,1,1,1,"Cities Skylines is one of my favorite games. I have plenty of hours or creating and designing cities. Even with all the dlc's and expansions that have been added, sadly it is modders who have improved this game the most. I wish devs put more options into building roads, highways and intersections. It wasn't until recently that a mod was created to build better highways, a easier way to build a traffic networks. I wish devs would add a dlc to improve and add more road options that would make merging lanes together easier. Piecing together every section of road or highway with mods is tiring. Everything else is pretty satisfying with the game though, just wish building traffic networks was easier."
1,1,1,1,"As an old SimCity fanatic, I love this game.  Way better than the new SimCity.  Reminds me of the old Rush Hour pack in Sim City 4 which I loved and it's expanded so far beyond it.  This game is much closer to the Sim City 5 that I was hoping for instead of the one that we got.  The only suggestion I have for developers is that they consider increasing some of the building limits for people with systems that can support it.  My very first major city that I started and I actually hit both the building limit and the node (Streets) limit.  Granted, the city was huge, but it limited it on adding a new building or adding a new sidewalk/path to my already huge city.  I understand the reason for the limits, but I think now that the game is several years old and computer CPU and GPU have advanced even further, it's time to expand on those limits a little more.  
But all in all, I absolutely love this game."
1,1,1,2,"There is no dictionary with enough words, to describe the sheer awesomeness of this Game. There has never been a city builder, So detailed, and so utterly massive and influential since the release of this game. I do not believe there is a way to top this masterpiece. That said, there are still multiple things I wish the developers would release as expansions. 

One, a major water physics update. Cities Skylines Dynamic water, maybe the very thing that made it famous, and while texture packs exist, there is still much that could be done to improve it. 

Two, Natural Disasters. The inclusion of this brought much fun, but it still felt like there could have been more. Volcanoes for example, with lava that cools over time, or perhaps whirlpools like in Simcity 3000 Unlimited, a game that EA has not re-released last i checked. With Dynamic water, the effects would be amazing. Ice Storms, which force the city to have to thaw itself with special polocies, these things could be improved. 

Three, Man Made Disasters. Everyone knows these can happen, in real cities either from poor planning or negligence, Cities skylines is limited in this category. It would be fun if there were more types of pollution, even radiation. And have way for us to experiment in figuring out work arounds or major clean up operations. Toxic pools, or even a scenario where we are given a toxic wasteland and must make a city out of it, and clean it up. These challenges would bring a new competition to the growth of the game. 

Four. Maybe perhaps this a bad idea, you can say so below, I have no problem with it. But on a personal note, I would love to open dialog with the developers, Because this is the game I had wanted since i first played SimCity, and now, I want to ensure that all future games that expand the city building genre meet the requirements and expectations of this game. Thank You so Much Paradox Games. 

You have not ceased in my mind to Wow. 
You keep me in Awe. 
Thank you."
1,1,2,2,"I greatly recomend this game! I usually don't do reviews, but this one deserved it! It is 20x better than Sim City. The thing I hated the most about Sim City was that you had a small plot of land to build on, but on here. You can  buy 9 more plots and then ontop of that get a mod to make it where you can buy 21 plots! Then the budget manager is a great addition to the game. Also, the integration with the Steam Workshop is a great bonus unlike Sim City. Then the game is very moddable so you can expect some great 3rd party mods to help improve the game. The only thing I would complain about is the traffic engine. The traffic AI is very stupid, but to my understanding, they have been fixing it to improve it. I GREATLY reccomend this game!"
1,1,2,2,"Hmm... a review. I think that after 110hrs of game play should say ive liked the game. After having new and better mods being built and better game play, This game is a huge step up from SimCity. The engine is much stronger and the Graphics are HD compared to others and the depth of game play is there. It is power hungry so you may need a beefy $1K computer. Having daily new player content is nice and I recently downloaded Night Life DLC to keep adding on. Really fun and easy to kill a few hours of your day or find yourself seeing the sunrise in the morning. Great City Sim and just a nice game.

UPDATE>>>

So CS, not a whole lot has changed from last review. CS continues to update and fix some performance issues and now I can get about 30K Citizens with 40FPS. DLC's & UGC's are nice and add more game play. Can tell that CS may be starting to slow down on progression and feels like they may be moving to a CS2? I wish that they would offer a way to integrate more HyperThreading to unlock more CPU power. Maybe a setting that is like Simple RIG (1 Core / 2GB Ram)  / Mid Rig (2 Core / 4GB Ram)  / Extreme RIG (4Core+ / 8GB Ram). That could be a programming nightmare i dont know... CS is still above all others current and past.

1,2,1,2,"I give this game two middle fingers for being the next least-friendly thing to productivity software while being fun.
Whoever didn't fund or ignored the UX team deserves to be fired. TL;DR: console-first design and mediocre usability ruins this game.

Pros:
- Watching your city come to life is satisfying. Each building detailed in a way [strike]Sim City[/strike] other city-building games miss.
- Many of the more micromanaged stuff is fun [i]but[/i] optional. If you'd like to name every street in your city, you can! Or you can live with generated names.
- Rich zoning options.
- So many mods (fewer than Skyrim, but. . .ya know.)

Cons:
- [b]THERE IS NO UNDO![/b]
- [b]THERE IS NO QUICKSAVE/LOAD![/b]
- It makes you daydream of hotkeys.
- I have spent 2/3rds (or more) time with the [i]MADDENING[/i] road placement.
- 75% of your roads will be one-way, and you will mess up which way you make the road. Which would be okay if there was a [i]UNDO![/i]
- There is no quicksave/load for when make your 500th mistake in the past hour with no undo.
- You can't draw a road/pipe through other roads/pipes? So if you have a grid, you can only create each street/pipe as far as the first one in the way. Really?
- The game has enough realistic mechanics to fool you into logical solutions to your traffic. Hahahahaha!
- There is no ""area"" delete. You have to delete your mistakes one inch of road at a time. T_T
- There is no ""hold shift to draw a square/circle"" for roads/pipes/routes.
- You can't just place a road and drag points into a shape, like an MS Paint line. You need to be a living protractor to use the curved roads tool.
- There are fake adverts in my fake radio.
- Fake tweets need far more diversity or utility."
1,2,2,1,"I played this game, then played it, played it some more. Stopped for a while, got the university DLC, then played more. This is a beautiful, complex, deeply layered, and wonderful game. The prebuilt maps are all fun, and the world builder editor opens up limitless possibilities for new playgrounds. The cities feel alive and evolving, and it's so satisfying to watch your zones fill in. I personally have the most fun building and managing the roads and traffic flows. The music is chill too honestly. 
Small things that would improve the game for me
-Buying more land tiles on a map
-Does anyone have an issue getting hydroelectric dams to work properly?
-Building road/train connections to outside the map, instead of just having whatever you start with

2,0,1,1,"I hope you have a lot of imagination because as you play this game it becomes very clear that outside of placing roads and zoning districts this game has much to be desired in the depth department. I feel myself on the brink of existential angst as I find that their is little to no reason to do anything in this game. Reaching milestones in game are nearly pointless as special, and overpriced, ÅgcosmeticÅh building are unlocked to spruce up your towns. Gameplay becomes tedious late game, if you can call it a late game, as you constantly place roads and zone areas again and again and again. The only thing that happens that ÅgspikesÅh the difficulty is when you run out of room to place roads and zones, and that challenge is overcome by buying more endless dead space so that you can place more districts and roads. People state that this game is a joy in the modding department, and that if you just let loose and mix things up by applying your own flare and creativity to city planning that this game just seems to open up. But despite all this I find the game to be a chore, a grindy and unrewarding chore. The faults of the game are further emphasized by the dlc direction that Paradox has decided to take with Cities skylines. Pointless and paradoxical (no pun intended) dlcÅfs are released for this game to include a radio show, snow maps, and concerts. Sounds good on paper, but snow maps are unique to themselves and add little to nothing to the base game. The radio show that adds tracks to ingame music can be circumvented by simply turning in-game music off and streaming music on your pcÅfs background. And concertsÅc.. Who the fuck asked for concerts, It's a single building that is much the same as any other overpriced single building cosmetic that you would place in your city, it accomplishes nothing provides superficial depth to a game that deserves better. No, instead of making dlcÅfs that would add to the base game and give further depth to a game that desperately needs it we get cosmetics and content packs that cater to exclusive, limited, and casual gameplay mechanics. Idk what they are smoking over at Paradox Interactive, they are literally sitting on a gold mine in my opinion. Can it be said generally that they game is ÅggoodÅh possibly, but i think if youÅfre being truly critical with this game it is ÅgokÅh at best and is easily forgettable which is a shame because if the game had gone in a different direction it could have been truly great."

8.) start again"
2,1,0,1,"Cities Skylines is a neat little city-builder that starts great but is sadly lacking an ""end game"". The graphics are cute and the mechanics mostly work. The lack of diversity in buildings or vehicles in your city can easily be fixed by downloading the hundreds of quality mods existing. The only downside to the game is that once you've understood the formula and reached a decent-sized city, there isn't much driving you forward to go bigger and better, and not much new to unlock. Hopefully they'll fix this in an upcoming patch or expansion."
2,1,0,1,"Generally okay but has some big issues.

1. The developers only release bad DLC that is next to useless
2. Too easy. Even without natural resources I can get easily a positive bank balance and never really worry about it again.
3. With natural resources after a couple of hours I had $15m
4. As long as buildings are covered by services there's not much else to worry about.
5. Traffic management is usually the biggest part of the game, ensuring that key buildings e.g Train cargo stations can service the 10,000 trucks that visit daily
6. Traffic is also pretty bad, on a 4-6 lane 1 way all of the trucks will stay to the first lane 75% of the time (mods can somewhat fix this though)
7. Solve traffic problems by building only metros (high passenger count, dont need to bulldoze)
8. Too easy to please citizens - they're never unhappy
9. Buildings like airports are fairly useless, so is tourism

So in short, if you're looking for a scenic city builder with not much challenge then go here."
2,1,1,1,"I really like this game.  The mix of design and management is perfect.  Since you are given a very large map to create any city you want with, the amount of creativity possible is endless.

This game has about ten DLCs that do not come with the base game.  I only have one of the DLCs (Mass Transit, at the time of writing), and I feel that I want only a little bit from each of the packs: fishing from Sunset Harbor, Trams from Snowfall, new offices from Green Cities, and so forth.  But, at over a hundred dollars for all of them, the price to value ratio is just too high for me personally.

This game recently received a free update, which gave us several new features that I love: above ground metros, eldercare, and childcare, to name a few.  With the release of a new DLC comes a free update, which makes the game better each time.  

I feel that Cities Skylines is a game that you can easily get hundreds of hours of enjoyable gameplay from, due to the almost endless creativity.  If you like management, creativity, and strategy, this game is for you.

My only complaint is that it takes skill to lay roads that make your city look good.  It's easy to lay grids, but they get old, and curly suburbs are hard to get right.

In any case, would definitely recommend."
2,1,1,1,"A great sim game to kick back and relax to. It takes away some of the stress that plagued past games of this genre by managing the interacting components well. It also allows the player to be as immersed or laid back as they need to be. The achilles heel would be traffic management, but it's a small price to pay for an otherwise very approachable in-depth sim game."
2,1,2,1,"This is the game SimCity wishes it could have been. If you love city simulation games, then you should look no further. The core game is amazing in itself. But then when you add a well supported modding community, this game is endless. 

The development team keeps fixing and adding DLC. The DCL in a few instances might not add as much as its worth, but they keep innovating. I think overall what they are adding is great and price appropriate! 

I really appreciate that the developers embellish core features and let the modding community take on content and advanced additions. I think people forget that not everyone likes having overly complicated features that the community offers. ??If however you want to extend your city to the brink, then there are really some Kick@$$ mods. Everything form a volumetric rain and drainage system to changing police cars sirens. Absolutely amazing, I highly recommend!! 


Pros- 
- Everything SimCity should have but couldnÅft be! 
- Modding community is highly supported and amazing 
- Easy learning curve
- Great graphics and style


Cons-
- DLCÅfs are both a pro and a con in terms of features vs price. But overall not bad. You donÅft have to buy them to enjoy the game."
2,1,2,2,"A wonderful game 8.5/10!

Pros:
1. No EA.
2. No DRM
3. Mod support from day one
4. Launch price is half of other games and I got it from GMG on discount! 
5. Large build space Composed of 2x2Km squares that can be unlocked 
6. Real simulation! 

Cons:
1. Easy (can be fixed with mods)
2. No auto save (can be fixed with mod)
3. Some wired UI decisions."
2,1,2,2,"Best City Building Game Ever.  

If you don't like paying for DLCs, don't buy them.  With all the mods and assets (for free, by the way) on Workshop for this game, the DLC's are not at all necessary.  I've been playing this game for years now (2,496 hours at the time of this review) and have never been bored once.  And the only DLC I ever bought was AFTER DARK Åc. only because it gave me bicycle lanes.  I've felt no desire to purchase the Disasters or the Mass Transit DLCs, even if they were dropped to $1.00 each Åc.. okay, maybe the Mass Transit one if only $1.00.
  
But I've gotten off-track of my point, which is that with all the mods and assets that are free for this game, you don't really need the DLCs.

If you just subscribe (it's free) to the First Person Mod by Tony56a, you can have days and weeks of fun just traveling around in your city.  As a Cim yourself or just riding along in a vehicle or a Cim wherever they go.  The game is COMPLETEY DIFFERENT ? and sooo much fun ? once you jump down into it and actually look at it from ground level.

Frustrated with creating a city?  Don't bother to create one --- on the Workshop, you can subscribe to a city of your choice (again, for free) that is already all set up for you, mods and assets, roads, city services, and all, and immediately start playing about down in the city as a CIM yourself.  Or you can start from there (with all the frustrating work of setting things up) already done for you.  From that point you can play with what you subscribed to or start adding in or removing anything you like from the city.

Anyone who hasn't tried this game is cheating himself/herself of one of the most fascinating experiences ever Åc. and I gotta tell ya, NO ONE could get me to play ANY computer games before I was forced by a family member to sit down in front of this one for one hour and play it.  Now I'm hooked and spend almost all my spare winter season hours on it  Åc  and, to my shame, some of my summer gardening hours as well.

And, honestly, for a vacation into a world you can make into your very own, the initial price is more than worth it.  If I lost it and had to start over and buy it again, I'd actually be willing to save up till I had $60.00 US and buy it again, if that was what it cost then.  And really, all anyone ever really has to pay for is the initial game, regardless of what the naysayers are whining about."
2,1,2,2,"The tutorial and UX are total crap - un-intuitive and hard to grasp compared to other contemporary games. First impressions - very bad.
For example - the game does a really bad job at explaining how you should connect the different resources (water, electricity, sewer system) to your city. It starts with sortof a tutorial, but the tutorial stops after a few steps and sucks balls in general.
Even after following a youtube guide (no thanks to the game developers) I still get ""not operating"" on my water pipe and water pumping station, which have been connected to the power plant. wtf.
There is one positive thing tho. I only paid 7? for this crap at 75% discount, so I guess I'll survive somehow. If you're smart, you will learn from my mistake."
2,1,2,2,"Having played Sim City games since the 90's, I find this to be a beautiful breath of fresh air.

Compared to my SimCity experiences, the MAJOR PLUSSES are:

-Roads are the primary construction, not zones. Organic bending streets reign over the poopty grid.
-No ""Advisors"": All needs are displayed via the Tweeter panel, or as speech bubbles on your buildings.
-Simple finance, tax, and loan modification panels.
-MODS. Whatever you need, it's there.
-Aesthetic. It's wonderful.

The bad (All mod related):
-Load times when over-modded (Is this even at all controllable by the developer?)
-All mods count as ""cheating"" and disable achievements."
2,1,2,2,"Don't play this game if you fancy a ""quick game"" before bed. Should you manage to resist the urge to carry on playing when you should be going to bed, then welcome to a night in bed lying awake, mentally working several differnt layouts to try the next day. 

Reminds me of when i use to dream of tetris.

A bit like SimCtiy but better with a mixture of Banished.

I love it

2,2,1,1,"best city sim in the world, but it does need some changes!

please remove deathcare, and maybe make vanilla road tools a bit better for people who don't have the patience to install 34160 workshop mods."
2,2,1,1,"More complex cities, no car rides or alien invasions, less of a game"
2,2,1,1,"The city-builder genre hasn't seen a lot of action since SimCity went south. Cities: Skylines might finally be the key to reviving it after its premature death.

It's basically what SimCity could have been in the modern day: a simple, straightforward city-management sim allowing for road construction, zoning, power and water management, etc., but with the addition of 3D visuals and no forced grid-snapping. It's also a lot easier than SimCity, with cities not going bankrupt in an hour or dying due to a 30-second interruption in water service while you relocate a water pump.


GOOD:

- Intuitive, straightforward controls - Cities: Skylines plays like a simplified SimCity, which is nice for someone like me who was daunted by how complex those games could get.
- Freedom from the tyranny of the grid! Finally, we can have curved roads and non-perpendicular intersections.
- A pleasing 3D visual style - you can freely look around your city from any angle you like, and it looks very nice, even up close.
- MUCH easier than SimCity - in SimCity, I could barely keep a city going until it hit 2,000 citizens before going bankrupt. Cities: Skylines makes it much, MUCH easier to make money, so your cities will last longer and lose that feeling of ""this game is only about playing until you inevitably lose.""
- The game is clear about when you've done something good/bad, but isn't pushy about problems in your city. Citizens will sometimes compliment your efforts in the Not-Twitter(TM) news feed when you install a new park or wind turbine, and they might give an occasional ""I like this city!"" shoutout, or they might complain lightly about noise, garbage, etc., but beyond that the game doesn't nag you about things. It feels good not to be pushed around about city problems and to get a kind word every now and then to know you're doing something right.
- A strong sense of progression - you can watch your city's buildings grow as they upgrade to larger structures, and population milestones unlock new buildings and services. You can actually see your city growing rather than just watching a population counter slowly tick up.
- High customizability - you can create your own maps and import custom models and textures for buildings. The Steam Workshop makes it easy to acquire and share custom assets.

BAD:

- Weird camera behaviors - the standard camera is a bit limited in its movement, which changes as you zoom in/out, and it rests on top of buildings if it runs into them. It can be confusing at first.
- The depth of field prevents me from seeing my city streets clearly, even when zoomed in. I don't want to turn it off because it looks nice otherwise, but I'd like to know how to adjust it.
- The lack of a grid has a downside - placing roads is a bit awkward due to a lack of snapping options, so your city can quickly grow unwieldy if you aren't planning it out carefully from the get-go.
- Unclear interface elements - the demands for industrial zones and office zones are shown by a single bar, making it very difficult to tell which one is actually desired. I zoned a bunch of area for industry only to have the bar remain the same and watch half my industrial area become abandoned. Zoning for offices finally reduced the bar.
- #Way, #way, #WAAAAY ##too ####many ######of #########these. The in-game Not-Twitter(TM) announcement system is grating to read through sometimes.
- The Not-Twitter(TM) feed posts the same few generic messages every few minutes. It's annoying to have repeat messages popping up all the time.


Highly recommended if you liked the classic SimCity games and wish they hadn't gone south the way they did. It's nice to see a city builder that not only attempts to revive the beloved SimCity formula, but endeavors to improve upon it."
2,2,1,1,good relaxing game
2,2,1,1,"A nice, quiet, city builder."

2,2,1,1,Amazing game!!!!!! I have an idea for a new DLC. Sunrise Islands... I hope Paradox Interactive and Colossal Order make it!
2,2,1,1,"Relaxing game, seems like it takes a lot more effort to play than what I recall of the old SimCity games but I can see it would be worth it when I'm ready to start spending that kind of time in the game."
2,2,1,1,"The possibilities of things you can do in this game are endless. So much things to try, new ways to run your city come up every milestone. Only downside a lot of people are a bit bummed about it that there is no multiplayer support. That still doesn't take away form the amazing experience the game is."

2,2,1,2,"Really fun game. Lots to do and explore, like building a massive city or learning how roads are built (which is complicated by the way). But if you love city planning, this is a great game for sure. And all the community mods for this game are also nice."
2,2,1,2,Warning. Be prepared to loose lots of sleep if you get involved with this game. It's everything you wanted the last SimCity to be.
2,2,1,2,this game so fit with my hobby that love to build something... enjoy the time and create a city really make me realaxed.. recommend it
2,2,1,2,great game fun and interactive better than sim city to me
2,2,1,2,"A City building game that works, cant say enough good things about this game"
2,2,1,2,This game taught me that I'd be a bad mayor.
2,2,1,2,it is a really fun game
2,2,1,2,Great sim game. Can do the game just basic with no mods and such (admittedly it doesn't look as awesome) or can go pretty deep in customization if you'd like/have the ability. I do feel the game has a bit of a learning curve (god I flooded so many people...) but overall it delivers a fantastic city builder experience.
2,2,1,2,cool
2,2,1,2,with the proper mods this game is great
2,2,1,2,I love this game it's what simcity suppose to have been! I'm glad to see the after dark expansion It looks like it going to my the game alot more interresting. Keep up the work guys!!!!!

2,2,1,2,Love this type of game.  Played Simcitys for years.  This is like a more complex version of those early games.
2,2,1,2,"This is a great civilization game, there is many great things about this game, from how real it gets to how some situations just play right into your own hands!"
2,2,1,2,buy this game - it has that big maps i fall in love ... so smooth like sc2000 in new clothes. i like the trains a lot!!! maybe more dirty patterned textures

2,2,2,1,"I highly recommend this game. The gameplay and graphics are amazing. I can spend many hours just following a bus, a ped or watching a responding police car's dashcam (with a mod for dashcams.) Even if that doesn't interest you, just building a city and maintaining traffic, public transportation and your budget will entertain you for hours on end. The only thing I find annoying is that cyclists cycle on the footpath if there's no cycle lanes."
2,2,2,1,Everything promised in the game is there and it works great
2,2,2,1,"Just no. Spent most of my half hour of play looking up why my water and electric systems weren't working as the game instructs you to build them. The twitter type mechanic, where your population complains and criticises you in the game, is just obnoxious. Definitely not reminiscent of the many, many hours I enjoyed with Sim City back in 1989, before single player games required an internet connection and an account just to load. Not worth the Åí1 I paid for it."
2,2,2,1,"Can be played again and again.... what if, my city favoured buses over metro, what if I swapped the power and sewerage outlets, how would it affect property values, taxes, health, education. So many what-if scenarios are possible."
2,2,2,1,"I spent my whole biology class drawing schemes and making notes for a circular city. At first I didn't like this game and the unusual system it uses made me just confused and frustrated, but few hours in turned into few days in, and now I have nightmares about traffic lights. One of the best city builders out there, definitely worth a piece of my sanity."
2,2,2,1,Cities: Skylines is what Simcity should have been...
2,2,2,1,"I grew up playing SimCity. I now work in local government administration. Despite my great memories of SimCity, Cities: Skylines has become the far superior city building simulator. There are numerous aspects that aren't realistic, but the complexity, the amount of customization, and more is fantastic."
2,2,2,1,This game is great and I love the continued evolution of gameplay and building in this game!
2,2,2,1,"Very refined city builder. Been a sim fan since the original Sim City came out, and while that series has been going downhill in recent years, I can say that Skylines has picked up the slack. It's not absolutely perfect, but it gives you a ton of options, and a ton of playability where it's easy to get into the game, but hard to master it. There's a ton of depth for those that love open ended games, and a ton to like. Recommend it for anyone that loves sim games or city builders."
2,2,2,1,once you start building a road with a couple of houses there is soon to come a GINORMOUS city
2,2,2,1,I wish I got paid for playing this game
2,2,2,1,good gameplay
2,2,2,1,This is one of the best sims...but I only wish I could  load my citiy and play it. A note says windows 10 may find a solution. When I wonder??
2,2,2,1,"*Keep in mind I actually have had real sucessful cities

Gets city to 15k

Starts having people move out due to inadequite amount of hearses

therefore people move out of homes

almost every home has a dead person

people perpetually moving from house to house

services and industry go down

everything is in anarchy

people leave or die off leaving the city to a population of 500

11/10 would destroy a city with dead bodies again"
2,2,2,1,If you loved Sim City games of old and were dissapointed in the latest offering from EA this is the game for you.    It is a fairly easy city builder with a great sense of progression.
2,2,2,1,"I got Sim City abd was hoping to get the Sim-Feeling.

I got it with Cities:Skyline."
2,2,2,1,"One of the best city sims I have played, Plenty of mods available. Micro manager's dream."
2,2,2,1,"city skyline is probably the most  timetaking game , but i love it"
2,2,2,1,"'Cities: Skylines' is what SimCity 5 should have been. If you're into city builder games, you won't find any real surprises, apart from the usual evolution in the genre. But everything is so much better executed that, let's say SimCity 4. Sure it's pretty, sure there are mods,... But where 'Cities: Skylines' really shines, is in the building tools it provides. Whether it is drawing complex roads, modifing terain, colouring zones, organising public transit,... the tools always cooperate instead of working against you. And that is quite a refreshing feature!"
2,2,2,2,"So closeee soooo close to being awesome..  A few more wonderful updates..  some mods sprinkled on top this game will dominate.   I would actually buy an expansion, if it added EXTENSIVE........... content."
2,2,2,2,Pictures

2,2,2,2,"I haven't played a city builder since Sim City on the SNES (yeah I'm old, bite me). But this...this is just phenomenal. The smoothness of the gameplay, the gorgeous graphics, the slow yet somehow progressive pace of the game makes this a joy to play. I definitely recommend getting the Natural Disasters pack to spice things up a little."
2,2,2,2,meh
2,2,2,2,sheeeit its aight
2,2,2,2,"I have come to simulation gaming after a long absence. In the past I enjoyed SimCity 2000 and Steal Panthers III. I am really enjoying Skylines - the art work, the detail, particularly the ability to drill down to where people or vehicles are going and why. gustavL"
2,2,2,2,"This is great game, but my computer cannot run it. I am looking forward to the day when I have a system that will play it."
2,2,2,2,Very fun and addicting game to get into. its a nice game to chill back with and play with mates. i didn't know much about this game but once you learn how to do everything its a very fun game.
2,2,2,2,Shitty for me but great for others without mods if you have a beefy pc check out my US metropolis collection of mods to improve the game.
2,2,2,2,I absolutely love this game!! Hours of fun to be had and the DLC's are definitely worth getting when they're on sale! I've had such a good time playing this game so far and can't wait to sink even more hours into it!
2,2,2,2,"As a person who has grown up with Sim City games it pains me to say this is better than the newest Sim City, but quite a lot. With that out of the way, this game is great. 10/10 for sure! Can never get old with all the mods and such!"
2,2,2,2,Best City Builder to date!
2,2,2,2,After disappointing Simcity thougth genre would be dead.  Cities Skylines proves otherwise. Highly recommended
2,2,2,2,It's Cities
2,2,2,2,"Positives:
Very Enjoyable
Extremely Moddable
Flexible to your play style
Published by Paradox Interactive (always a plus)

Negatives (Kind of..):
Somewhat Expensive DLCs 
Loading times when the game is heavily modded

All in all highly reccomended!"
2,2,2,2,Its like playing sim city. Except it doesn't suck. I really felt like i was playing sim city 2000. Which was my all time favorite. I can't remember the last time I played a city builder. That i lost hours of time. 10/10
2,2,2,2," This game is a micro-manager's paradise. I get lost in this game for hours, whether I am redrawing or rezoning districts or changing the stop signs on roads throughout the city. This game can be as in-depth or as big picture as you want it to be. Though, several hours into gameplay one might not have the option to be so hands off as Cims (the people who inhabit your city) have a nasty habit of dying off in droves later down the line when you zone large residential areas all at once. This causes hearse congestion and it's my biggest hurdle in game play. What all this means is that eventually you'll have to get creative and roll up your sleeves! I have spent numerous hours on this game and I wouldn't take any of them back. If you're a fan of management hospital or park sims like Roller Coaster Tycoon or Theme Hospital, or if you've ever played and enjoyed SimCity, you'll be sure to enjoy this game."
2,2,2,2,It's fun
2,2,2,2,If you find yourself missing sim city 4 De Luxe way back year 2000.. Cities Skyline will brings you back in time but with the brilliant graphics and new game system that you will never seen before!
2,2,2,2,Yay there snow now :D
2,2,2,2,"After eight hours of playing I can say that this game is everything that was promised. It's free of bugs as far as I can tell, runs great on my machine (which is getting quite old) and besides all that: It's just a great city builder! Trying to figure out clever road layouts, trying out new policies... there are always challenges left besides just filling some more zones. It's great fun so far and if I didn't have a paper due in a few days I'd not have stopped playing at 5 in the morning but rather would have played on and on and on.... ;-)"
2,2,2,2,epic.
2,2,2,2,Very Good
2,2,2,2,I hereby recomemnd this game to people that are some kind of wanna be logistics etc.
2,2,2,2,Great game.
2,2,2,2,"YES. YES. YES. It's the game we have all been waiting for, and even though I've only played 3 hrs, I'm enjoying it much more than SimCity 2013. YES. GET. THIS. GAME."
2,2,2,2,Yes
2,2,2,2,Yet another launcher

2,2,2,2,Sim City 4 meets Colossal Order with Paradox Interactive to create your wildest desireable city building dreams!!! :)
2,2,2,2,A better city simulator than simcity2k4. Modding support is excellent too with tons of contributors making some neat things. Making a city has never been more rewarding.
2,2,2,2,"The best building simulator you can buy. Cities Skylines is great simulator of city building and actually taking care of it, because with bigger and bigger city you have more problems like traffic flow, crime rate, fire, health, education... but mainly the traffic :D. It may be little harder on the first time, but with time you can build really impressive, beautiful, huge and working cities."
2,2,2,2,The absolute best city building simulator around. They took everything wrong with the SimCity franchise and improved upon it. My brain can't wrap around how in-depth this simulator gets. It will take over your life in a good way.
2,2,2,2,1
2,2,2,2,A challenging city builder.
2,2,2,2,I have this for both the Ps4 and Pc .My husband n loves it just as much as I do after I showed gameplay .It has its corks but all in all very fun to play .
2,2,2,2,Better than sim city
2,2,2,2,epic
2,2,2,2,"Best city builder ever, period."
2,2,2,2,I can't say enough how much I love this game! It's an incredible sandbox game that's breathtakingly beautiful. Props to the developers for their hard work!
2,2,2,2,good game
2,2,2,2,best city builder :)
2,2,2,2,very good
2,2,2,2,good
2,2,2,2,you get to play god
2,2,2,2,"To give this game a bad review, that's curious. Help me understand. Why would you do something like that? It's just such an unsavory thing to do."
2,2,2,2,"Nice, Very F*** Nice. Love IT."
2,2,2,2,fun part is flooding your city
2,2,2,2,"I mean this game is amazing with the workshop additions.

Almost 100 hours"
2,2,2,2,Fantastic!  Finally bringing the genre back to where it should be. Highly recommended.
2,2,2,2,Were you the kid who played roller coaster tycoon but only made miniature railways and then got mad that your guests didn't ride them?  If so this game's for you.
2,2,2,2,The pre-eminent city builder game. Especially with a few choice mods. I highly recommend Cities Skylines if you're interested in city builder games.
2,2,2,2,"great game, gets better with each dlc pack"
2,2,2,2,"Are you a long fan of the Simcity saga?
Were you dissapointed with Cities XL, XXL, XXXL ?
Are you having any doubts about Cities Skyline?
Are you looking for user reviews, hundreds of YouTube videos and wondering, should I buy this game? is it really worth it?
If your answers to those questions are YES.... then you should buy Cities Skylines right NOW!
Trust me, I hardly write any reviews and to be honest, I was about to let this pass. Now I want to travel back in time and beat the s*** out of me, steal my credit card and prepurchase C:S 
It's 5:54 am in the morning here in Argentina, I can't sleep because of this game. THIS IS TRULY what you are looking for my friend.

TRUST ME, HIT THAT ADD TO CART BUTTON RIGHT NOW.
Gotta go now, my ""metropolis"" awaits!"
2,2,2,2,"What's to say that hasn't been said. It's the best city building game since Sim City 4. We're fortunate to have a developer create such a lush, and well running game as this."
2,2,2,2,Best city builder out there... would recommend this game to everyone!!!
2,2,2,2,Best game ever
2,2,2,2,"I personally think this is the best city building game I have ever played. You can be the government-
you can download mods to make a roman empire; and you can make a canals town.

I love this game; im like the emperor from star wars. Anyway I think ye should by this and the cities skylines is the best.

Oh also you can shape land: YEAH!"
2,2,2,2,Awesome game! A must have!!
2,2,2,2,"This is a very fun alternative to Sim City. It's pretty tough to start out but when you really get the ball rolling you never seem to run out of things you want to add or get done. If your sick of the same old from ""The Sims"" this is a very fresh take on city building. I like to play when I just wanna sit back and watch most of the time. Only have to use the mouse. One last thing, must have the Mass Transit DLC to play as well. It helps with roads and traffic a lot!"
2,2,2,2,I really dig it
2,2,2,2,So great
2,2,2,2,"1. download tons of mods
2. make city layout
3. planned out everything
4. start building the city
5. need more workers
6. no resource to sell
7. garbage piling up
8. dead people everywhere
9. traffic got messed up
10. the whole city is a mess
11. start over with new city
12. all the things above happened again and again

10/10 would start a new city over and over"
2,2,2,2,city
2,2,2,2,3 hours had gone by before I knew it when I first got in. 50 hours later I still have no idea what I'm doing but it's very fun to play.
2,2,2,2,Good Game
2,2,2,2,hilarious game
2,2,2,2,Best City Builder with more options on the moding end. 10/10
2,2,2,2,Great game... Very addictive
2,2,2,2,It may not be perfect but it is still a city builder with a lot of potential.  I can't wait to dump countless hours into this game.
2,2,2,2,"I love this game and its workshop creators, and i will continue to love it for the many more hours."
2,2,2,2,yessir
2,2,2,2,"I do building and when i do building i do it large

This is what City building is all about with enough simiulation to keep even the most brainy of kids playing for years to come."
2,2,2,2,"Placed a water tower and went bankrupt.

12/10, would place water tower again."
2,2,2,2,Best city builder since SimCity 4 rush hour.
2,2,2,2,"I've had maybe one or two play sessions in this game, and if anything speaks to how the game pulls you in, it's starting a game at noon on a Saturday, and looking outside and seeing it's suddenly dark out. Six hours passed while playing my first game, and that was just with messing around with no real plan for a city!

This seems to be a recurring theme with Paradox strategy and management games -- if you're the type who likes a game that can just immerse you like that, then this is for you. If you find yourself thinking ""6 hours?! And he didn't even really achieve anything??"" Then you probably feel the same way I did after I realized how long I was playing. It can still be fun if you're the latter kind of person, just set timers just in case you get too immersed like I did that first time."
2,2,2,2,A great game worth every credit spent on it.
2,2,2,2,my citizens are always unhappy and they keep complaining about not having clean water well im sorry karen its not fucking easy running a whole fucking city jeez
2,2,2,2,It has good graphics.
2,2,2,2,not the worst game I've ever played
2,2,2,2,Better than SimCity
2,2,2,2,It is a really fun city builder. It has a lot of inter-connected viables that make it more than just a build a cool looking city type game. I love it so far.
2,2,2,2,top 10 anime buliding sim
2,2,2,2,"This is a great game to play, and visually, it's absolutely beautiful. I highly recommend this game if you like city builders."
2,2,2,2,There are no words to do this game justice. I'm 27 hours in and I'm still in awe of all the little features I keep finding.
2,2,2,2,"The game looks great, I was really excited to try it out after hearing tons of good things about it. I'm sure I would enjoy it as well if it wasn't for the fact that there is no tutorial and the game has lots and lots of layers. There is an ""advisor"" option for hints but all it does is dish out vague things like ""expand your city"" with no instruction on how to do it. If you have hours and hours  free to learn how to play this game buy watching third party videos then I'm sure you'll have a fantastic time. If, however, you expect that games give you basic clues on what the hell to do and how any part of the game works, you will be disappointed."
2,2,2,2,highly entertaining and addicting!
2,2,2,2,Decent.
2,2,2,2,Great Game
2,2,2,2,"Honestly addicting. Should probably stay away. The vanilla game is great, but the ease of adding additional content through subscriptions has compelled me into 81 hours in 5 days, which is probably unhealthy in and of itself. I've lost a lot of sleep, become less productive all around, BUT I've had a blast, so has my girlfriend (so I have now bought the game twice with all of the expansions) and have designed some pretty amazing cities. Definitely love that the game came out in 2015 but there is STILL updates within the community everyday, just adding to the entirety that is this game. Sim City on crack, and just as addicting as regular crack. Thank you for something to fill the void!"
2,2,2,2,"In a way which makes you think, ""Why didn't we get this sooner?"", Cities: Skylines truly leaves nothing untouched. A game which picked up where SimCity 4 left off, this modern take on the otherwise barren waste of city-simulations manages to shine like a diamond in the rough. Everything which you would imagine should be put into an intelligent simulation game can be found within this title. Everything from district planning to managing traffic and the public transportation system has been thrust into this game. For 29.99, this game not only promises and delivers, it exceeds in every single aspect of play. It has color, flavor, spice, and clearly was built with love by the handful of developers who poured blood and sweat into its creation. Perhaps the best city simulation of this decade, Cities: Skylines is a game you won't soon forget, and would be a fool to miss out on. It is utterly fantastic. 10/10"
2,2,2,2,"it's very addictive to see your town growing, people livng their lives, cars driving and stuff. Easily spent 10, 20 hours without noticing it. Howewer the DLC parts looks unfinished and need more polishing."
2,2,2,2,One of the best city builders i've played! love it
2,2,2,2,i study college innit
2,2,2,2,"A good and addicting game. You literally build your entire cit, expand it, make it better to live in. The game has its charm"
2,2,2,2,"Twitter. Why god, twitter.
But my people love me, so that's a bonus I guess.

10/10 would be annoyed by constant twitter feed again.

P.S. This game is amazing. Seriously, but that sh*t."
2,2,2,2,"Really nice game!
Just sit, relax and build the perfect city"
2,2,2,2,"Cities: Skylines is a great city building sim, with tons of modding support. I myself was very disappointing in SIM City when it came out, but after playing Cities: Skylines I realize this is the game that should have been. and I am glad to have a chance to play it even if I am a little late to the party. 

I haven't had much time to play it during this free weekend, but I can say that I definitely enjoyed the experience. The tools are simple and easy to use, and the gameplay is easy to learn, all while feeling to have a lot of depth. I cant say for sure how far that goes yet as I have only just started but everything seems to be on the up and up. This is one of the best city sims I have played in recent years, if not ever and I recommend it to fans and newcomers alike."
2,2,2,2,amazing game have played over 500 game hours
2,2,2,2,good
2,2,2,2,"The true follow up to SimCity 4! A great game to lose yourself in for hours, or days. And with content from the workshop, the game moves up to whole new level. I don't think that the price is bad for the base game or the DLC. The trick is to wait for a good sale.

This game is great for people looking for a true city builder, but if you are looking for a fast pace this is the wrong game for you."
2,2,2,2,"When you buy it, you play for a long time on and off, but then you discover the mods. The sweet, sweet mods. At this point you have surrendered you life to this game. Could not recommend this game more."
2,2,2,2,"Good game. Very CPU Bound, so make sure you have a decent CPU if you want to make larger cities."
2,2,2,2,goood
2,2,2,2,The most fun and relaxing game on Steam.
2,2,2,2,"Awesome game, even after playing it for hours."
2,2,2,2,This absolutely scratches that itch for Sim City.  Sandbox building at its best.  Fully recommend.
2,2,2,2,"This is by far my favorite simulation game ever. And I've been playing sim games for a while.
What makes it so special? To me, a mix of how detailed and how micromanageable it is. Being able not just to control almost every aspect of your city, but also watch the game rolls by after you get a stable balance in your economy and city growth is not only rewarding, but it's extremely fun.
You can also play for a long time and have tons of fun with only the original game too, and the DLCs always add up new positive experiences, different maps and more challenges.
If you enjoy Simulation games and specially City Builders, there is no way you can go wrong with Cities: Skylines."
2,2,2,2,Great game!
2,2,2,2,"how to lose track of time, the game"
2,2,2,2,The best city builder I have played.
2,2,2,2,great game.
2,2,2,2,Fun
2,2,2,2,A very good city-building game. I recommend this to anyone who played SimCity 4 and wants something more recent.
2,2,2,2,It's great!
2,2,2,2,"classic, best of the best"
2,2,2,2,Awesome game ! 10/10
2,2,2,2,Fun
2,2,2,2,"I havn't played a city sim since SimCity 2000, and this one is great. After seeing what my roomate went through with the newest SimCity by EA I decided to hold off and I am glad I did. This game has everything SimCity has but more, and then the Steam Workshop available from day one: Simply AMAZING! Great game if you like city sims."
2,2,2,2,Best city builder / city manager out there!
2,2,2,2,One of my favourite games for over 3 years now
2,2,2,2,"Awesome Game !!
This is the best city building game ever."

2,2,2,2,very cool simcity go burn in hell
2,2,2,2,e
2,2,2,2,Best city building game since Sim City... (of course not the latest sim city)
2,2,2,2,"Building Dubai here , dreams come true :D"
2,2,2,2,"If you've played SimCity before:
Cities:Skyilines has far more content than SC, but SC has a bit better atmosphere. Despite not having multiplayer gamemode, you can enjoy the game with your friends while speaking via Skype, Discord etc. 

If yo've never played any city managing game before:
It is worth a try, it has great game mechanics, lot of content, and you can have a never-stop-growing city.

Tottaly recommend"
2,2,2,2,sweet
2,2,2,2,"very fun, makes you be creative"
2,2,2,2,"one of my favourite games, when i played this game, i  would know i cant stop until tmr morning, so highly recommend"

2,2,2,2,Its great!
2,2,2,2,"Amazing game, keep coming back to it and finding new ways to play, if you like city builders, just get it."
2,2,2,2,"This game is great. Can't really believe the amount of time I've managed to put into it in the week during release. It's not even starting to get old yet, well worth the price."
2,2,2,2,City
2,2,2,2,"This is the game that i can play for days and than stop to play it for months (i played it before i bought it)

2,2,2,2,because fun
2,2,2,2,I love this game. It's classic SimCity style city building with modern interface magic. So much <3.
2,2,2,2,"Outstanding, quite simply the game simcity was meant to be, but more."
2,2,2,2,"A handful of flaws, but this fun and addictive city-builder still climbs high."
2,2,2,2,Very Good
2,2,2,2,"Easy to learn, hard to master.  That is the theme of this city building sim.  Very addicting and hard to put down!"
