Hope some one can help realy want to try out the game since Im a Trucker. I work for Swift LOL even though I got it for free. Im not mad just wish they could fix it. As far as House fliper thats another story."
0,0,0,0,"Waiting for another update. Vive VR in the beta branch not currently working. It will boot but will not use all resources of the computer and thus the game is a choppy mess even on the lowest settings. (My gear plays all my other VR titles just fine.) GPU and CPU usage shows at around 3% and it get's bad fps because of it. Coding issues to connect to hardware propperly. 

Not sure how the game is outside of VR because why play a driving game where you can't look around now that the tech is available. Will update this as soon as they send out a fix and I can try the game.

Now it has many bugs. As example, when I pass over a speedbump or a border on the road, my truck starts flying around getting 100% damage, or the cabin gets in a weird position and it's not drivable anymore, and every time I have to call service.
These bugs are pretty annoying and I'm sure I'm not the only one who meet these problems."
0,0,1,0,"Love the gameplay, but would like one issue to be fixed - I can't seem to use my Corsair Scimitar RGB at all when I play this with my Xbox One controller. I believe my game crashed when I attempted to use my mouse by waving it around. Other than that, it's one of the best singleplayer games around that I have seen so far on PC."
0,0,1,1,"When I first played the game it was ok. like with all games I had to figure out what to do before i could start using and playing the game. The game is very simple and plain in terms of graphics and enviromental objects such as pedestrians and things which could make the game more fun and enjoyable to play. 

It would have been cool to have police chase your truck and give you a ticket, however police are present in the game, but they only flash their lights they dont say or do anything to you except the game gives you a vehicle crash penalty. The game is tediously boring to play it would have been nice to gain points for indicators and such and maybe have drivers design their own courses and deliveries there could have been so much more put into this game I found the game very limited in terms of play. 

I over looked all of this as I used the game to just practise driving around but then in the end the game became very buggy for me and whenever i reached 50 mph the steering wheel would flip to the other side which ultimately caused me to crash and damage my vehicle several times during gameplay. I would like to add that all the signs are wrong also some of the speed limits are like 90 and 100 mph which obviously you can not exceed greater than about 60 mph. I had to uninstall the game I wish I could get my money back but obviously i have played the game for too many hours :("
0,0,1,2,"I would recommend this game but it comes with a few catches, if you don't mind the radio not working all the time (so it will play sometimes then other it stops) it will be fine and sometimes the GPS messes you up when there is a crash it will not give you anther way around, the last problem is don't rely on the signs on the road look at your GPS speed as the roads are mostly for car speeds. Otherwise this game is solid!"
0,0,1,2,"This is a great Truck simulator.

Pro:
- Great graphics
- enjoyable gameplay.
- beautiful light
- nice trucks
- playing with multi monitor it gives you wider angle of view.
- tempomat

Con:
- I have an old force-feedback wheel. Wheel is working, but FFB don't (note someway I found solution to the FFB)... and the pedal became ON-OFF switch, however that is a normal pedal. Without gas pedal I cannot hold the speed. If I push the gas button, it accelerates. Without tempomat this prg is not playable!
- It has the worst GPS I've ever seen. It cause many accident it does not warn you where to take the corner, which track is going to straight... etc. This is the difficulty in the game. It doesn't have good perspective program on the device. Either it shows the way too far or to close.
- sometime AI vehicles behaves dull. They hit your carriage, but it should give way to you (sign shows there). 
- you can buy many update for your truck but it does not explain you what benefits you do buy with them.
- sensitivness is not adjustable by the wheel that would be a real wheel feeling (note with the FFB it is OK)
- so many button necessary to use. It can disturb your attention. Best if you use a controller and wheel together.
- There are no green light with arrows indicating direction you can go. All of the crossing has full green. Why?
- Sometime it does not want to turn off the ""monitor power off"" function -> everything goes to black. So it is a bug.
- It is a seat to the 2nd driver, but I cannot hire driver as a mate. So the sleeping remains."
0,0,2,0,"I would recommend this until they fix the micro stutters. I used to love playing this, but as of recent, it has become unplayable. The game stutters all the time, which makes it impossible to enjoy. I see this is not a new issue either, people have been reporting this since 2018, so I do not know why they are not fixing it? I have gone through every forum post and every YouTube tutorial on this issue, and not one has worked. What I have gathered is that its there engine that is buggy."
0,0,2,2,"The game simulation is really nice , the problem is the game crashes at launch. I have tried all possible solutions which sometimes did work but to often the game has crashed leaving me with a black screen unable to do anything apart an forced switch off which on the long run can damage your drive or even your os. So sadly i uninstall the game. I have tried to get support from SCS but on their website i could not find any."
0,0,2,2,"Fantastic game but I found the add-on Scandinavian and Baltic roads extremely frustrating with constant speed changes making trips slow and instead of enjoying the scenery and game you were concentrating on not getting speeding fines.

I also found many bugs where the speed changes altered so frequently in a short space of time that you do get speeding fines for doing the correct indicated speed.

I have moved to the American Truck Simulator, offering a fantastic enjoyable game but miss the Ferries and planning that I enjoyed with Eurotruck 2."
0,0,2,2,"I never thought I'd get hooked on one of these ""Euro Sim"" games, but I did. There is something very Zen about just driving along the countryside, with your lead foot and the beautiful landscapes around you. If you've ever travelled Europe by rail or car, this game can be a very nostalgic and dramatic experience.

My only complaint is that sometimes the game ""lurches"" -- that is, when you are driving at a constant speed, the truck periodically slows down and then catches up again. During the lurches, the framerate does not seem to drop, so it seems that something else is causing it to bottleneck. I'm playing on a GTX 980 with a 3Ghz i5 CPU and 8Gb RAM, so I doubt my system is to blame. At any rate, the lurching doesn't occur constantly and it doesn't really detract from the driving experience, but I still hope that it gets sorted out in a future update."

1,0,1,1,"The game is good, especially with a mods.
Unfortunately, the simulator is not so detailed and you can not fully experience the thrill of keeping a truck.
The game allows you to take and carry loads from point ""A"" to point ""B"".
There is support for controllers and manual settings, the map is just beautiful and the roads are relaxing!

- There is no option to disembark the truck and attach the trailer, no cosmetic injuries occurred, you do not have the option of picking up and reading the cargo documents, missing signal signs that are placed on trucks for different categories country codes, speed limit, warning, ecology warning and others (E, EEV, G, L, S, A, R, H, R, III-VI, ROAD, TRAIN, OVERSIZE, TIR, 22, 265, and etc), there is no tuning for the brands volvo, man, iveco, mercedes, the game also needs an online option - LAN/Dedicated Servers (without mod) ...

1,0,2,2,"OS: GNU/Linux 
Distro: Arch Linux 

Very cool and addictive game. Yes, you can remove truck speed limit :-D Some awesome mods, and loads of great ones. Great community as well.
Some issues with the game, AI still needs a bit of work (it got a lot better with 1.9.22, changelog also states advancements in that regard) in my opinion; infractions sometimes occur without you having any control over it: AI car crash into the trailer, when truck's doing a tricky turn, everybody knows a truck with it's trailer needs space! Or when re-entering a highway, sometimes AI cars will just stop, and even when they have enough time, they won't step on the gas and get going. Waited for them to get going sometimes almost 2mins, they should get going when they hear me using the horn! :D
The map could use some more improvements, better exits on some gas stations (no acceleration lane), for example.
The GPS could talk your way around, with a sweet female voice, preferably. :-)
Actually seeing the drivers hands on the wheel, using the parking brake, turn lights, gears, that'd be awesome and add a lot more life to the cabin view."
1,1,1,1,"A very fun but poorly named game.  It isn't really anything like a simulator and a better name would have been Euro Truck Tycoon.  The 'tycoon' aspect of this game is very good and I hope for the next version that they expand upon it by possibly letting you hire & manage mechanics, dispatchers, etc.  To improve the simulation aspects I would suggest adding insurance and drivers license consequences for accidents, make accidents visually realistic (visible damage) and more catastrophic.  To further improve the immersion more diverse weather is needed (where's the snow in the mountains?), and consider improvements to the wear & tear mechanisms as well.  To expand on the arcade aspect of the game, adding police who pull you over rather than just auto-tickets would go a long way but also adding some sort of bidding-for-jobs against competitors or a race aspect (bonuses for early delivery?) would be fantastic.

The driving aspect of the game is good and can be challenging, however if you are looking for a simulator then Euro Truck Simulator may not be the game you want.  The scenery in this game is gorgeous, and if you like working toward expansion goals you will enjoy hiring & managing drivers, buying garages and trucks, and building skills.  
"
1,1,1,1,"I really like this game alot. I have most of my play time with keyboard controls but I now have a wheel, pedals and a shifter and the game got so much better. I play both offline and with the multiplayer mod. I wish they would update some graphics of the environment and update some of the roads with more interesting landmarks to drive by. I have mostly good things to say about this simulator and I recommend it, especially if you have a steering wheel.

Edit: I have now gone over to play this in VR with Oculus Rift S and I must say that I enjoy the game even more now because of the immersion. I also notice so many things about the environment and the other traffic that I didn't see before when I was looking straight ahead. There are lots of details actually, but they are easy to miss on a flat screen. Now it looks as if I'm inside the truck and really driving it. I used to wish for an eyetracker or something to be able to turn my head, but I must say that there is no way to be more immersed than to move over to VR. Although VR headsets could use a bump in pixel density because when looking in the distance it kind of looks like you are playing Minecraft, but if you are looking not so far ahead it's just so nice."
1,1,1,1,"ADD MULTIPLAYER PLEASE
TO MEET OTHERS PLAYERS :)"
1,1,1,1,"Awesome simulator game! Enjoyed every hour of exploring the map, and creating my very own trucks. The DLC's makes the game even more fun as well as the many workshop items. It made me love trucks and driving in general.
Despite the well developped map, I would like to see larger city's, they are very small. The traffic is always the same, altough this can be fixed by mods/workshop items it would be a nice improvement to add some traffic jams at busy hours/busy places or random events like accidents or traffic works. - Edit:  Despite these random events & detours that have been added I still would love to see an option to add more accidents on the road which really causes traffic jams."
1,1,1,2,i love this game its very relaxing odliy i hope that new dx12 version will be made in time with bigger maps maybe 80%more streets and buildings that show the citys as they realy are 9 out of 10 easy
1,1,1,2,"This game is soo relaxing it's weird, espiecialy if you got wheel and pedals it's very fun. i wuild recomend it to everyone who likes bussiness and traveling around the europe thou they shuild add more of europe like the eastern europe and northern like sweeden, estonia, a bit of russia, latvia and so on.

After they released the going east dlc and scandinavia dlc:

the map is soo much bigger. im very happy that they listen to the community and improve their game.
but for me there is never enough of the map.this might be too much but i would really like to see more roads on the map like thorugh vilages and stuff and also add more of italy, more france,and eventually spain. actually just add all of the europe in the game."
1,1,1,2,"First off, I highly recommend this game. Provided you also get he following DLC, High Power Cargo Pack and Going East Expansion. The first adds new cargo and trailers that are both more rewarding and heavier than the original cargo variety. The second adds a large new section of map to drive, and many more cities and countries. Both are well worth the added cost. The other DLC's available consists of custom paint jobs. They add nothing to the gameplay, but you can buy those if you like them.


About the game;
You are a truck driver in Europe. You select what city you want to base your future company in, and start out working for companies delivering cargo with their trucks. You gain experience with each load that is safely delivered without doing too much damage. You can choose to buy your own truck as soon as you save enough money, or by getting a loan from the bank. If you own your own truck, you can upgrade or customize it however you choose (once you obtain the experience levels to unlock the upgrades wanted). You earn more money if you own your truck vs. driving a company's truck. As you get more money and discover various cities, you can buy additional garages and hire drivers to work for you... increasing your income. You will have to buy a truck for each new driver, and upgrade your garages to gain space for more drivers.  Garages come in 2 sizes. Small has space for 3 drivers and costs $180,000  A small garage can be upgraded to a large garage for an additional $100,000. A large garage also has a fuel pump for your benefit.

While the game is a good game, it is not without certain shortcomings.
First, There are many features that SCS had the code for from prior releases in the series that could have been included but were not. In Hard Trucks wipers had 2 speeds, now they only have 1. In Extreme Trucking, you had a variety of weather and road conditions, from ice and snow, to dirt roads and steep terrain. Here, the weather is very simple... it is either not raining, or its raining. Roads are all paved and quite uneventful. Hills are gradual, and the roads are formed from a set pattern of road sections that have been copied and repeated over and over. 
Another omission is that much of the available upgrades do absolutely nothing.  Most trucks offer 3 different truck cabs. A standard cab w/ no sleeper, a standard cab w/ sleeper, and a larger cab with a bigger sleeper. None of the cabs affect the trucks fuel economy, handling, or performance. The addition of a sleeper does not enable you to rest anywhere that a non-sleeper truck can. It's all purely cosmetic. Same for the transmissions. Al trucks come with a 12 speed transmission regardless of engine. Upgrading to the other 12 speed transmission does nothing for the performance or fuel economy. Tires are another thing, no matter what tires you choose, the handling, performance, fuel economy and wear are the same. All pure cosmetics. Adding a front bumper or guard does nothing to increase the durability of the truck. the AI traffic pays no attention to the existance of the roof mounted safety strobe lamps, nor is there and aerodynamic penalty for the wind drag from a roof mounted light bar full of lights and horns. Horns are ignored by traffic as well. Both horns and roof safety strobe lamps are purely there for cosmetics.
The AI traffic has it's own issues. They will change lanes suddenly, stop suddenly, crash into you, and cause traffic jams lasting over an hour. They also are prone to hauling ass... I've been running 102 mph and been passed and couldn't keep up with traffic cars before in 50 mph zones.
A big issue relates to the drivers you hire and the trucks they drive. It does not make one bit of difference if you buy the cheapest truck you can get (a $97,000 Man for example), or buy the most tricked out, most powerful, most expensive truck (A fully decked out Scania or Volvo costing $275,000+)... you earn the same. Upgrading their trucks does not speed them up, enable them to haul heavier loads, or make them happy... It doesn't do anything. Save your money and give each driver hte cheapest basic truck you can buy. You also cannot see the other trucks on the road, nor in the garages, ever. They only exist as a small thumbnail picture in the manager section.

Things I'd like to see in future updates:
More weather types... Snow and Ice, hail, fog, etc...
More variety in roads, Steep hills and switchbacks, narrow roads with high dropoffs and no guardrails. Dirt, gravel and pothole filled bumpy roads. Roads with deep ruts.
Functional tires that have varying grip depending on terrain and weather. Make better tires last longer or have better traction than cheap tires.
Adjust the engine outputs and trailer load weights so that pulling a 55,000lb trailer with the entry level engine is nearly impossible... making having a more powerful engine something you both need and desire. Adjust fuel economy so that the more powerful the engine, the worse your mileage (currently, there is no difference)
Make upgrading trucks for your driver have a benefit.
Make traffic AI react to safety hazard strobes (stay back a safe distance, give way when turning, etc...) as well as move over when possible if you blow the horn at them.
Make truck cab differences matter. If no sleeper, you stay only in a Hotel or at your upgraded garage. If a small sleeper, you can rest at gas stations and rest areas, but you have to rest longer to get a full 11 hrs driving time. If you have the large sleeper, you rest better, so you don't have to rest as long to get fully rested.
Add additional transmissions to different trucks. Some trucks have 10 speeds, some have 18 speeds..

Amazing game."
1,2,1,2,"OMG THIS GAME.. I love this game, it is simply one of the best driving games out there. I hate driving games and racing games but this one actually got to me, I even got a steering wheel specifically for this game! The graphics are beautiful and its actually fun to play! I only wish that it would have my home country Sweden and Finland / Norway on it, so therefore 0/10.


...

but i guess trucks are pretty cool so 9.5/10"
1,2,1,2,"The Greatest simulation game I've ever played, Euro Truck Simulator 2 offers an immersive experience like none other in its genre. The graphics and cabin detail is wonderful, and this is one of those few simulation games that actually have true physics that are realistic. You feel the weight, the power, the size and the essence of your truck and the cargo you carry. SCS software have gone above and beyond to create the ultimate truck driving simulator - going as far as adding a radio function that works wonderfully. Little to no bugs and the free roam features make this game even better.
I cannot recommend this game enough if you enjoy driving simulators, and it's even better with a wheel, pedals and gearshifter (H-shifter is nice). 
I'm sort of being picky with this, but the only thing I can see which can be added to the game is Steam Cloud support. Because nothing is more annoying than gaining 118 hours of game time only to move computer and loose all of that. Plus, Steam doesn't always seem to push the updates like it should do. But again, I'm just being picky. 
11/10."
1,2,1,2,"First off I will start with the two things I think they could improve. When youÅfre driving on a highway which speed limit is 50 and you are going 50 but a car passes you and speeds off into the distance, it doesnÅft seem like they are going the speed limit, which could easily be fixed. The other thing is even if you are at 100% damage your truck shows no wear what so ever, I am not saying to make it into a crash simulator, just to at least make the truck look dented. Other than those two things the game is very fun, if you are looking for gameplay this is not the game for you. This game is for people who want to relax and enjoy the scenery, not race or something like that. ETS2 is fun in a way that doesnÅft make sense it is just overall enjoyable. If you tell someone you play ETS2 they will probably laugh, though if you are talking to another person that has the game they will completely understand your love of ETS2."

[h1]Premise and gameplay[/h1]
Euro Truck Simulator 2 casts you as an up-and-coming truck driver in Europe. You start out doing freelance jobs for other companies who provide you with a truck for each job, eventually amassing enough money to buy your own garage and truck, which is when the game truly begins. Of course, you can always take out a bank loan, but if you want to stay debt-free, you have to work for that money. You can always take a quick job if you feel like it, but to gain access to the most powerful trucks you need to buy and upgrade them yourself, both visually and performance-wise.
After each job you will gain money, experience and truck upgrades. Experience can be used to level up your driver in various ways. For instance, you can put points into certifications for dangerous cargo or long distance driving to unlock more job types or eco-driving to reduce fuel consumption and the resulting costs.
Once you've got your truck company off the ground you can start expanding by buying more trucks, hiring drivers and more garages across Europe. The game doesn't offer much in the way of micro-managing you employees, but you can upgrade their trucks in the same way you upgrade your own and decide what attribute they should focus on levelling up.
Do note that there's no win-state in this game. It just keeps going while you expand your freight empire and if you want a clear goal you need to set it yourself.

When you're ready to hit the road you either pick from a list of available quick jobs or go the the freight market to find cargo to haul with your own truck. Quick jobs are great if you just want a quick fix, as you don't have to drive all the way to pick up your cargo. If you want the pure experience you buy a truck, pick a job and drive to pick up the trailer before embarking on your journey. Along the way you will need to follow the rules of the road and watch out for traffic. Any and all traffic offences will result in a fine, which can severely bite into your profits if you're not careful. While you can get away with speeding, there are speed cameras along most roads that you need to be on the lookout for. You also need to keep an eye on your gas tank and your sleepiness levels and pull into a gas station or rest stop when needed. When you arrive at your destination you can choose to park your truck yourself, which can be a true challenge in certain locations, or relinquish a handful of experience points by using auto-park.

One immersion breaker is that there is no real in-game economy to speak of. Everything stays pretty much static no matter what happens in the game and there are no realistic cargo chains (i.e. raw materials to factory, products to store). This will hopefully likely in the near future as the developer has created tools for creating such chains and has implemented a few in the Scandinavia DLC.

[h1]Presentation[/h1]
Since I'm so late in writing this review, I'm lucky enough to write it after the 1.17 patch was released. This patch brought plenty of changes to the graphical presentation, most importantly the lighting. The game is definitely no Project CARS, but it has absolutely been serviceable and is now even more so with the improved rendering engine. Some scenes are made absolutely gorgeous by it. World textures could definitely use some upgrades to make the game a look bit more realistic and some models look a bit basic, but overall the visuals of the game are just fine. Not mind-blowing, but they do the job well.

The trucks themselves are modelled in stunning detail, and the Mercedes-Benz New Actros that was released in patch 1.18 takes this to a whole new level. It's clear that a lot of love and hard labour has gone into the trucks and they are definitely the highlight of the game's presentation. The only downside to the models is that the switches and knobs inside the cabin aren't adjustable. I may have been spoiled by other pure simulators, but it would be a nice touch if you could actually use the physical buttons instead of mapped keys on a keyboard or controller.

The physics simulation leave a little more to be desired. The truck cabins don't sway as much as they ought, which is especially noticeable during roundabouts or when decelerating. Trailers don't [i]feel[/i] heavy, but just slow you down, and there's very little feedback from the road surface.

The sound design as a whole is serviceable. The truck sounds are of course very good, but the rest of the sound scape doesn't feel as fleshed out. Not that it matters all that much when you spend most of your time inside the cabin (which [i]is[/i] the proper way to play), but it would be nice to have a some more prominent ambient sounds to instil a sense of place when you pull over and turn off the engine. If the truck sounds or road noise aren't to your liking, there are loads of mods available that remedy this.

The world design is generally pretty good. Areas like Great Britain and Switzerland feature some of the best roads and vistas the game has to offer, but some areas feel very bland, especially Germany, which unfortunately is the country you travel through the most because of its location. These areas have generic roads with generic intersections and generic city layouts. It all starts to feel very same-y when you pass the same copy-pasted intersection for the fifth time on a single haul. Some off/on-ramps are also very confusing, where one lane suddenly turns off the road without any heads-up. The signs don't always indicate correctly and these intersections are unrealistically common in the game.
The DLC that has been released is a lot better in this regard, but if you want to up the fidelity of the base game, there are a lot of map mods to try. ProMods is one of the bigger mods that add new areas to the game, but they are also currently in the process of redesigning a lot of the base game to get it up to scratch with the new areas.

The game also supports TrackIR and Oculus, but I haven't had any chance to try these features out.

[h1]Controls[/h1]
The game supports keyboard & mouse, gamepads and steering wheels.
The controls for kb&m and gamepads are fairly straight-forward and work just fine. The wheels are way more interesting and you get a lot of settings to perfect your experience. Earlier, the trucks had some wonky wheel rotation properties, but a recent patch gave all trucks 900? rotation. I haven't found any settings I feel are missing, either. There are multiple sliders for different axes and FFB settings, all buttons are rebindable and there is a useful wizard for quick setup.
The force feedback feels a bit ""grindy"", though. I use a Logitech G27 and it feels like the engines struggle with providing resistance, almost like they're slipping on sand. This does not happen in other games, where the feedback is tight and grippy. I have no idea what causes this, and it doesn't seem like any of the settings fix it. It [i]works[/i] and can give you a juicy jolt if you crash, but it's not what I've come to expect from force feedback.

[h1]Summary[/h1]
Despite some technical flaws this is one of my favorite games. It's a solid package and great for a relaxing evening of driving.
If you can stomach long drives, gradual progression and being responsible for your own fun [strike]in an open world[/strike] on the open road, this game comes highly recommended.

1,2,1,2,"First of all, it's a great driving simulator! With proper steering wheel you feel the size, you feel the weight, you feel the struggle of you poor 460HP engine carrying 24 tons! Its great! I like the traffic, I like the roads, I like the feel of spending money on new truck! Finding well priced job on the market is exciting, leveling driver feels rewarding, upgreating your truck feels like Christmas shopping. All of that is great... but now the cons. Economy part of the game is pure arcade. I understand it, common player don't have 3 years to expand his company, so all need to be speeded up. But it still feel crazy getting 30+ euros per km. Game got only main roads on the map, so don't be surprised seeing closed road due to accident and having additional 100-200km to drive when taking alternatives. And it happens often. So often, that I start to ignoring it! Road closed on every 2nd or 3rd job? Just ignore the police and try to drive closed road anyway, usually it's possible and you'll not be fined for that! Not possible? Go wrong way on motorway, its only 100 euros fine! You'll be fined 1000+ euros for +7km speeding so who cares?!? Fines are additional story here. Sometimes I fell like it's not simulator but educational game for 10 years old. No police, no cameras, but you'll still get ticket. For speeding, for red lights (and yellow is red, if you don't believe me, try it), for collisions. Maybe it's possible in Norway, when due the police absence old vikings gods takes action, but in Poland for example? We can drive here +10km/ph in front of police and they will not even blink they eyes. Cameras will take the picture when you're +20km/ph over. Too many paperwork and no profits for fines under 20km/ph. 99% lights don't have cameras, so where this tickets came from?!? So what you're doing? You keep ignoring it as well. When you got 20k+ euros per job, who cares about 2-3k of fines? Take the limitation of your truck, if you're fined for +6-7km/ph, why not drive 130km/ph+ on your important jobs, make it 40 tons racing game! But you know what? It breaks the immerse and all the realism is gone. Fix this stupid fines for everything, this basically not happening in real life! Lower the amount of closed roads or add all the network and let me go back on motorway next entrance. Then it will be really great driving simulator. I'm too old, having too many kilometers on the road to educate me, just let me drive like in real life. That the simulator is for!
I'm very curious about your opinion"
1,2,1,2,"This is one of the best games on steam. I really recomend downloading ets2mp, though. Then you can play with friends.
This game has great graphics and is made very well.

This game is also very chill to play on evenings. You can easily play this for hours at a time without thinking about it.

Really recomend this to anyone, even if you dont like trucks nor Europe. :)

Things I wish to be added:
Finland, more Norway and more Sweeden [SCANDINAVIA DLC]
Maybe a ÅN""Baltics DLC"", Lithuania, Latvia and Estionia
South Europe: Spain, Greece, Portugal etc."
1,2,2,2,"Truck game? I don't even like truck in real life and I always hate it when i got stuck behind one in a one lane road. So I tried the demo of this game to see whats all the hubbub is about. And from being annoyed by truck, this game helps me to form respect and appreciation toward truck driver and somehow annoyed at myself as i see myself in the AI behaviour in game. Like ""WHY THE HECK ARE YOU SLOWING DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD NOW I NEED TO GEAR DOWN AND BUILD UP AGAIN ALL THOSE LOST MOMENTUM YOU PIECE OF..."" now i drive my car and react properly with trucks on the road. So i bought the game and the journey begins...

It is a very relaxing game that I always fired up during weekend nights. But it also can be challenging at times like hauling the oversize cargo with steerable axle and then trying to reverse park it in one go. Some of the good points about the game that I can think of:-

-The map is huge and it's getting bigger every year.
-New trucks and tuning packs are introduced every now and then.
-New trailer and challenges are introduced as well (heavy cargo, high power cargo, double trailer, and soon to come special cargo)
-Mods:-
+Huge list of mods with multiplayer mod stands out at the top (TruckersMP). You get to have a delivery convoy with your friends or stranger and witness some funny stuff on the road. And it's fun to chat using the CB radio or using other 3rd party voice chat app like ts or discord. I've also joined virtual trucking company and make deliveries based on requirement of a virtual company. If you like role-playing, TruckersMP mod really offer that part in this area. 
+Map mods is just unbelievable and the attention to details in some of the map mods is just astonishing (ProMods, RusMap, TSM, Eldorado... to name a few).  I've driven in snowy region of Iceland and desert of North Africa. 
+Truck Mod and trailer Mod. The truck that you want to drive isn't in vanilla game? chances are there is a mod that allow you to use that model of truck out there. My fave is Volvo VNL with Baobab tree trailer climbing mountain of Eldorado Map mod.
+Truck skin and trailer skin, company name and skin, gas station brand name and fuel price. All these are mod-able that it helps in immersion. 
-Constant update and development of the game. You can tell that they really love the game and that's all I need from a developer.

And that's only what i can think on top of my head. I'm sure there are a lot more points that I haven't mentioned.

But like any other game, there are things that can be improved such as:- (in my opinion)

- the graphic. The graphic is still limited to what DirectX 9 can offer. I'd imagine that having this upgraded will tremendously improve the quality of the game in term of graphic and performance. 
- the ability to own your own trailer and pick up cargo from factory and deliver it. There is still no option for this yet.
- damage system and physics. The damage system is still pretty basic, like if i get into an accident, when i go to service station i can see what the percentage of damage for different part of the truck. I completely fixed the engine and transmission. I ignored the cabin and wheel damage. After leaving the service station, my truck engine died with message ""engine malfunction"" when i know it's completely fixed. It's just the tire and cabin that is still damaged. So it kinda defeat the purpose of having option on what to repair at the service station... oh and it would be nice to have visual effect of a damaged truck. Like my cabin is 100% damaged but in game, it looks brand new and shiny all the time.
- attention to detail. For example it would be nice if we can interact with the interior of the truck like pushing button on the GPS nav, radio, roll down the window, go out of the truck to attach/detach the trailer. And also, there is still no cable connection between the trailer and truck even though the wires and cable is hanging behind the truck, I guess they are connected via wifi?... 

well these are just my opinion. Whatever it is I'm still enjoying the game with my friends. :)



Update - much of the im provement has been met. and lots of development. good job scs and modding community."
2,0,0,0,Cloud saves tag is false. This game does not cloud save your file.
2,0,0,2,very good game but having some problems with it at the moment and cant semm to find out what it the problem
2,0,0,2,Great truck driving in Europe and Asia stuff. The only flaw is their freaking flat nose truck
2,0,1,1,"Cops in the game are unrealistic and unnecessary. I roam in the game, whenever I overspeed, a cop shows up and gives a penalty, double the default penalty. This is no real. Feels like game forces to send cops whenever the player excesses speed limit. It should be definetely improved until it makes sense. Overall, cops in the game makes me not to recommend this game."

2,0,1,2,"Played ETS2, now am truck driver. Impressed with dev support of the game, still continuously updated, doesn't run the smoothest in VR sadly but with a bit of tweaking you should find some settings that work for you."
2,0,1,2,"I play this game when I want to get away from the boredom of real life, and experience boredom in a virtual environment. 

The main enjoyment from this game comes from sticking to the speed limit, stopping at red lights and being able to use your wipers in the rain. Negatives include not being able to buy the awesome soundtrack to this game, the fact that flashing other lorry drivers does not yeild a friendly flash back 100% of the time, and that this game actually exists.

As a whole, I will never get bored of being bored playing this game. 10/10"
2,0,2,0,"Since I bought this game ETS2 I cannot find the Key to activate this game, could you please tell me where it is located"
2,0,2,2,"I really do not know why I play or like this game :) I have a demanding job with idiot clients, fool bosses and problems all the time in real life. What I do in this game is just enjoy scenery and complete tasks, get paid. My mind is at peace with this game.

Life is already hard enough and I closed all the realistic stuff: fines, speed limiter, manual gear etc. I ran through red lights, speed when possible, life is all the moments you enjoy yourself"
2,0,2,2,"its a decent game myself and others enjoy playing the game
but,
It seems that lately who ever is in charge of Informational update postings section when steam users follow a game and its update postings, The company tends to delete peoples posts on feedback regarding those game updates people select follow on, 
even though those people including myself has given good compliments to the company.
several people have already questioned to the company as to why their post have been deleted. 
I myself asked that question as well,
as I also found out, that my posts responses have been deleted as well, even though I was giving them a compliments.
and I also stated to them that I have given a compliment and wondered why my post have been deleted by who ever is incharge.
1 hour later yet again for the 4th time, My post along with those asking the same which have been MANY have been deleted yet again.
It would seem that if you are not giving 100%+ or more horays on a post, your post will be deleted instantly by who ever is incharge even if you are giving a compliment.
Not cool at all."
2,0,2,2,"My original review was at 145 hours, I'm sitting at 820 now and my opinion hasn't changed.

It's a great game that still gets updated after all these years. It has a bunch of trucks, trailers and most importantly mods. 
If you like trucks, simulators and driving get this game. It's only 5? on sale, and if you can I'd recommend you buy every map expansion (On sale ofc) because the base game countries/cities do look depressing when you compare them to DLC countries.

All in all it's a 10/10."
2,0,2,2,Bad game everytime i launch it it keeps crashing WHY???????????????
2,0,2,2,"Jack won't buy this game for Åí3.74 because he's a stingy cunt. I have only bought cosmetic DLC for my Scania wankmobile and I'm satisfied, bought the game for full price too, don't know what his problem is

Edit: An absolute legend gifted it him so now we get to bully him on TruckersMP"
2,0,2,2,"It's super fun to play this game with a Thrustmaster steering wheel and pedals. Sadly the AI is dumb as bricks. They don't react to your blinkers and don't abide traffic rules. They have a destination and drive when they want and where they want. Right first, traffic lights or blinkers mean nothing to them and they love ramming into your acid filled container.

Despite the AI I recommend the game!"
2,0,2,2,"After all these years of developing truck driving games, SCS still makes shovelware. I can't bring myself to outright praise them yet. The game engine shows its age with mediocre lighting, low draw distance and noticeable pop-in, no matter how much you crank up the settings. Also in some places you will get FPS dips and stutters (even on a high-end pc). But, to be fair, since its first release, ETS 2 had come a long way and reached a level where it's entertaining and varied enough to make you wanna ignore its shortcomings and keep coming back to it. And it's slowly getting better with each map expansion."
2,1,1,1,"Serious driving game where you have to use a truck to transport freight from one place to another. Basically that's all. You can also improve your truck but apart from the engine, the rest are just visual improvements. There are no explanations about them so it's like trial end error. You can also hire drivers to drive your trucks but again, that's all. They drive for you and earn money for your company. Overall, it's just a well designed truck driving simulator; they tried to include managing options for trucks and deliver companies but in my opinion those are not well implemented. If you like or are curious about driving a truck, this game is a good option to start with."
2,1,1,2,"After driving an impressive 98'000km in game. Being a veteran trucker adds more fun to the game as you begin to understand the fundementals of it all and you become a better player at completing missions and getting out of tricky situations.
The only bad point that needs mentioning: I have found myself, more than once, stuck at a highway intersection (Under a bridge) with nowhere to go due to traffic lodged up from all directions and not being able to move at all. I had to carefully squeeze between the vehicles and the hill, knocking over a roadsign, just to get out of there. The only problem was that I had to do a U-Turn on a tight road, with a long trailer, to be able to get on the correct on-ramp and that caused some damage to the truck and trailer.

Other that that, everything feels real. You feel the difference when you're without a trailer and when you're with trailers of different types and wheight causing different driving techniques. Some trailers allow aggresive driving while others don't. You even have the option to hire drivers that bring you extra income while they drive missions for your ever expanding business.

In short, it's a great game for anybody who loves driving and loves a good simulation. Missions of all types allow you to do a short mission if you don't have plenty time or save in the middle of a long mission and come back to it at a later stage. The autosave function also comes in handy in case there's suddenly a power cut. True story XD"
2,1,1,2,Best simulator game I've ever played. I recommend to everybody this game but one suggestion. Please be careful with driving in multiplayer and don't speed 24/7. Oh and one more thing when you see trukish people then just drive as fast as you can :D.
2,1,1,2,"This game... how should i start. First of all, the game is great fun. Big World, lots of roads and cities. Secondly, all standart trucks are already great trucks, every standart truck is licensed and is very configurable. 
The modding communtiy is unbelieveable big, if you get bored with your standart truck and map, you can download tons of stuff, from a russian map to tons of trucks and more things you can put on your truck. Nearly everything is possible, have seen trailers with tanks on it. But not every mod is compatible with another mod, it crashes from time to time, you just gotta figure out wich mod the crash causes.
But, speaking of mods, there is a thing called ETS2MP which is, yeah you guessed it right, a multiplayer version of the game. There are already thausands of people playing the multiplayer verison, I am one of them and can say it's really great.
All in all, I fully recommend this game for everyone wh searches a bit of relaxing gameplay, or for everyone who likes ""drive"" games.
I'm sorry for any grammar mistakes, english is not my first language."

2,2,1,1,"Great realistic game of transporting goods over Europe! Weather can affect your driving, you need to keep up on fueling the truck and taking rest breaks on long hauls. Allows you to purchase trucks, drivers and garages to grow your business. Fun game!"
2,2,1,1,"I bought this game for my little brother. I end up playing more hours than he did.

Everything is nice, awesome control varieties, graphics is descent for a simulator, listen to your favourite radio stations while trucking.

The Multiplayer mod adds so much fun to the game! Since it can get a bit lonely driving for hours down the road.

(*ADDED IN!) The only thing I'd hope they add in is an FOV adjustment, and that more road scenarios like, cars broken down and accidents of other vehicles.

If you're looking to spend time on relaxing and slow paced games, this is the one for it."
2,2,1,1,Need more realistic on this game !
2,2,1,1,Great graphics and there is always something new being added to the game.
2,2,1,1,"This is very good game thx for the game.
"
2,2,1,1,"Incredibly addictive game. I found that out after I realised I played 28 hours in two days :O Anyway I have always been aware of SCS games and played Hard Truck and 18WOS back in the day and the other ""simulators"" (UK,GER,ETS1). They were ok but lacked somthing in my opinion. SCS have really nailed it with ETS2 by bringing the managment side into the game. I very much like transport managment and driving games and this combines the two. SCS have announced American Truck Simulator, I hope they keep the managment mode and build on it. Maybe more in depth managment, maybe competiors? With the release of WOT Alpha maybe they can add a multiplayer aspect where your freinds can join your company as drivers vise versa. That would be incredible. 

Another great feature is the internet radio built in. Listen to live music from across Europe :D

Anyway fantastic game. Im going back to do some more miles while listning to Radio Metal FR \m/

Mods are fantastic additions to the game but money mod and xp mod users are lame! Play properly!

WE NEED HGV CLASS 2 RIGID BODY TRUCKS!!!"
2,2,1,2,Most relaxing game in the game
2,2,1,2,"This is probably if not the best then one of the best driving sims our there!  Almost an endless amount of things to do including free roam, in game jobs, and world of trucks jobs (if you link your profile).  Choose from a variety of truck manufacturers and customize your truck with different acessories, paint jobs, body styles, motors, transmissions and so much more! Stright up 10/10, no strings attached!"
2,2,1,2,Peaceful stress reliever :3
2,2,1,2,This is perfect game simulator of Trucks! :)
2,2,1,2,"This is a game that's very easy to glance at and write off as being some sort of weird, boring niche product. It's a game about driving trucks around, and to a lot of people that's not going to sound like riveting gameplay. You should really give it a shot, though. This is a truly fantastic game.

There's sort of two sides to Euro Truck, both of which are really well-executed. On the one side, it's a driving sim - you just cruise the highways of Europe, night and day, rain or shine. It's peaceful, cathartic even. On the other hand, it's basically an RPG, with levels, unlockable upgrades, etc. For me, it presses all the same mental buttons as progression systems in a grindy JRPG do.

You really have no excuse not to give Euro Truck a shot. It's frequently on sale for under $10, and chances are high you'll end up having a bunch of fun. Two years on, the visuals are starting to show their age a bit, but that's really the only complaint to be made about this game."
2,2,1,2,"Surprisingly, this game is nowhere near as boring as it looks and sounds. If they still had demos, you'd realize what I mean. Since you can stream internet radio into the game, it's a great way to catch up on the news or listen to podcasts in a somewhat relaxing environment. Not having driven anything larger than a box truck, I can't say how accurate the simulation is, but I can say it's not realistic, simply because all the trucks feel the same. Upgrading the engine makes it accelerate faster, and there are a few different chassis configurations, but the feel is barely impacted.

If you come at this game expecting a ""king of the road"" experience, like the blurb claims, you'll be disappointed. Even if you did feel like king of the road, your subjects (the other cars) have no personality or purpose other than to serve as obstacles. The way to think of this game is as a sort of zen-like experience. Once you get on the highway, turn on your favourite radio or podcast, and begin to relax, you'll see why I've spent over 100 hours pretending to drive shipments of toys around fake Europe."
2,2,1,2,"Unlike many of the other simulators out there, Euro Truck Sim 2 is incredibly well made, polished, and enjoyable. There is actually gameplay that leads to an endgame, which is rather rare for simulations. On top of that, The amount of customization for the vehicles and your shipping empire are numerous."
2,2,1,2,good game and simulator
2,2,1,2,"Miles of the asphalt in front and in back makes you feel like you really are a truck driver on the route to almost all capital and big cities of the heart of the world, Europe. Everyone should have to try it and meet some unexpected road situations on his path from Ostrava to NewCastle Upon Tyne."
2,2,1,2,"An interesting, fun and extensive game.
Never gets boring! Great for people that love playing simulators as it closely mirrors the actual every-day life of a truck driver. Get jobs, deliver loads, manage your trucking company and even more! Endless possibilities and amounts of fun."
2,2,1,2,Very Relaxing Game
2,2,1,2,"There's nothing like sitting back, filling your bottom lip with tobacco, and hauling 13 tons of equipment across europe with the radio on."
2,2,1,2,cool game
2,2,1,2,realy relaxing game
2,2,1,2,A great game with a great community behind it. Has good map expansion DLC's. Highly recommended.
2,2,1,2,"A great game to kill time and relax.
It will way more fun if you playing in multiplayer.
But be careful when driving ;)"
2,2,1,2,fun chill game.
2,2,1,2,its  very much better than the new x box version of a truck game ...actualy its top notch tbh
2,2,1,2,"This was a very beautiful game and it made me very emotional because the landscapes were hyper-realistic and breath taking. I love being a trucker and driving the truck around for countless hours on end, However i disagree with the lack of representivity of the Black and LGBTQII++ community.

This game is multiple times better than the modern day teen-addicting games such as Minecraft and Crush Crush because it teaches a valuable lesson. ""truckers are tough men""

This simulator felt more like a stimulator because it made me feel in control and i was able to play for hours on end, unlike in real life where i am not in control and don't last long with the mrs.

I felt racially targeted by the police that gave me speeding tickets, even though it is a computerized system, it still felt wrong and immoral.

It is a shame that one must purchase a truck before freely driving around without the need to do a job, however this adds to the realistic effect."
2,2,1,2,"It's all in the title, really. Just some relaxing trucking with lite crew management elements and stuff, but that doesn't really matter, you're here for the trucking, and trucking you shall receive!"
2,2,1,2,"A fantastic simulator, that only continues to get better as you play it.

Definitely a very zen game at times, especially with longer trips. Add a good podcast or music playlist to the mix and its perfection.

And with the vast array of DLCs, as well as steam workshop content, you can add endless hours of content on top of the base game itself.

10/10"
2,2,1,2,Fun game. Relaxing. Feels like work sometimes. Better with a steering wheel. graphics are well the games was released in 2012.
2,2,1,2,"awesome game with new updates and also fun in this game
"
2,2,1,2,"Relaxing in a weird way. Repetitive both in gameplay (you literally just accept contracts, drive for 30 real minutes at least, and repeat, with a little tycoon management thrown in) and road patterns, but that doesn't actually take away from the game. It's great as is, there's just room for more but it's still perfectly acceptable without anything else added to the game."
2,2,1,2,"8/10

Pros:
-Relaxing graphics
-Ability to use online radio stations during driving
-Interface very user friendly
-Economic and managing aspect

Cons:
-Towns/Sceneries look pretty much the same
-Resource-eating for what the graphics are

In general I'm neutral to good about this game. I wouldn't recommend it but I would tell you that if you like driving you will <3 this."
2,2,1,2,"Absolutly fantastic Game. Lots of great content, and great extendability of gameplay of new areas to explore. Couple this with Truckers MP and you have a great sim. All steering wheels and Shifters add enormously to the gameplay. 5 out of 5.

2,2,1,2,The game feels immersive and I find it very relaxing to drive long distances and visit all the different countries.
2,2,1,2,It is a fun and relaxing game driving your truck through europe.
2,2,1,2,"The game maybe straight up boring at first but the way you can drive through multiple routes to get to a delivery point and how you drive makes it a worthwhile to play. Overall, it's an amazing game"
2,2,1,2,Time Killer.
2,2,1,2,Vey relaxing and chill game. If you have too much free time it is a really good choice.  Don't drink and drive! (You may take too risky actions and pay for damages) :D
2,2,1,2,"Never been to any European country so i had to rely on playing this game or watch pictures. 


Better than google's street view/10"
2,2,1,2,"This is one of those games that surprise you - I thought that I would never be interested in a game about truck driving - and here I am after several years and over 200 hours in-game (and almost the same in American Truck Simulator). 

This is a great, relaxing game, and if you invest in a good steering wheel - it's even more revarding. Over the years SCS Software added a lot of new contenct (both a free updates and also as paid DLC's) and the game is still in development. 

A wide range of countries, cities and trucks makes it a great game for truck fans and gamers searching for a relaxing title. I usualy listen to podcasts or audiobooks while driving and it works really well."
2,2,1,2,very epic lol funny
2,2,1,2,The graphics are insane the quality of the game maps roads is just unique and fantastic I really love it and with mods you can even play it with Multiplayer. Thank you for this awesome game.
2,2,1,2,"Amazing game. Always updated and the modding community is huuge, and its a great addition to the game as you get some fun and must have items on the workshop. a MUST game if you love trucks and driving :D"
2,2,1,2,"nice simulation game
"
2,2,1,2,"this is the best game i have played, it makes you feel like you are in the trucks. you find new countries improve your driving as well you can buy garages,truck and trailers you can also hire people for your company so you can earn double the money i think this is the best game I've played on PC. 
"
2,2,1,2,"The game is awesome.
Its fun to explore new towns, new trucks, but DLC's and have fun with your friends. Create convoys and have fun with other people all around the world, the game must be played."
2,2,1,2,this game is awesome it is really realistic and one of the most best graphics i have ever seen in a pc simulation
2,2,1,2,"Not for the hardcore gamers as the title suggests, but this game is possibly the best way of relaxing perhaps with some music in e background. 

Graphics - 9/10 (is comparable to Battlefield 3 when on max graphics)
Gameplay - 9/10 (a few movement glitches but otherwise outstanding)
Sound - 5/10 (suits the game but becomes repetitive and annoying)
Overall - 8/10"
2,2,1,2,Driving a truck but much cooler
2,2,1,2," So Chilling and relaxing experience for me. The game looks awesome and plays just the same way. IÅLm playing with and Xbox one controller and, although I thing the full experience would be playing with a wheel and pedals, with the controller and keyboards you have everything you need.

You star as a driver, working for hire until you earn enough to buy your own Truck and start making you own deliveries and more money. I still have a lot to play, I did not buy a trailer yet nor have I got an employee driving for my company. But that thing are what motivates me to keep playing and making deliveries.
The skill tree works very well with the game and the scenery IÅLve seen so far its amazing.

I recommend this game to everyone who likes a relaxed simulator experience (until you have to park the trailer hahaha)"

2,2,2,2,"I couldn't believe that I'd ever like this game. I thought  this would just  be a boring simulator, where everything happens in slow motion because it's trucks. But boy is this addictive and strangely calming. I use it to wind down after a day of work.

I highly recommend this game."

2,2,2,2,"You know, I have put almost 750 hours into this game and I never once thought to review it. I did want to say I completely love this game, it is very well put together and well maintained for a game released in 2012. The ability to use mods and buy DLC for this game has kept it fresh and the fact that it is constantly updated, including parts of the original game (not just new, DLC areas) which makes it worth every cent I paid for it. 10/10 would buy again"
2,2,2,2,"This game is AWESOME its so fun. I dont know how driving a truck is so fun, but it is. Its even more fun with a wheel. 10/10 highly recommend."
2,2,2,2,"So slow to get started but if you like grinding, this might be one for you. Bank loans are the key! Theres a good life lesson..."

2,2,2,2,Amazing game I loved.
2,2,2,2,Great game to just sit back and relax...
2,2,2,2,Very fun and addictive. Only downside is you'll soon be swimming in lots of ingame money.
2,2,2,2,"Definitely a fun game! The graphics are great and marvelously realistic, and it is more fun than you might think to drive a truck - even in a game! :)"
2,2,2,2,Very good game :))
2,2,2,2,very nice and relaxing time killer. =)

2,2,2,2,"Brilliant game, spent over 100hrs and still not bored of it, we use multiple accounts as we can drive different trucks as different companyÅfs starting in various parts of Europe.

2,2,2,2,One of the best Simulated games! worth buying all map dlcs and playing multiplayer!
2,2,2,2,"This is possibly the most enjoyable and addictive game I've played centred around such a logically dull activity. This does though make this a wonderful game for relaxing while playing, and it probably has the single best controller support of any game I've played. If you want to use two flight sticks, a steering wheel and a gamepad all at the same time, somehow, you can!!"
2,2,2,2,good game
2,2,2,2,"It s a nice game and very relaxing if u play with a pro whell!

Also a big shoutout to the developers of this game they just keep adding new stuff. If you like simulators and driving a truck you should absolutly buy this it's worth all of his money.

11/10"
2,2,2,2,"I was working night-shift and thought that i needed a game that i can pause and continue.

and so far this game does job, its honestly quite addictive. For gamer that usually plays FPS this was really a pleasant surprise. its runs on my low specs (ryzen 7 integrated graphics)

the game it self is great casual experience, drive a little around in europe, go to the UK and drop off.

I can only recommend this game."
2,2,2,2,In my opinion the best simulation game. It is both enjoyable and relaxing and it has a multiplayer mod.

2,2,2,2,"A game you think will be absolutely boring and stupid, you play for a few minutes and you...just...cant...stop. Highly recommend downloading the Multiplayer mod"
2,2,2,2,"While I cannot offer a review of this game, I can offer my favorite recipe for beef wellington. Enjoy!

For the Duxelles:
To make the Duxelles: Add mushrooms, shallots, garlic, and thyme to a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. Add butter and olive oil to a large saute pan and set over medium heat. Add the shallot and mushroom mixture and saute for 8 to 10 minutes until most of the liquid has evaporated. Season with salt and pepper and set aside to cool.
For the Beef:
To prepare the beef: Tie the tenderloin in 4 places so it holds its cylindrical shape while cooking. Drizzle with olive oil, then season with salt and pepper and sear all over, including the ends, in a hot, heavy-based skillet lightly coated with olive oil - about 2 to 3 minutes. Meanwhile set out your prosciutto on a sheet of plastic wrap (plastic needs to be about a foot and a half in length so you can wrap and tie the roast up in it) on top of your cutting board. Shingle the prosciutto so it forms a rectangle that is big enough to encompass the entire filet of beef. Using a rubber spatula cover evenly with a thin layer of duxelles. Season the surface of the duxelles with salt and pepper and sprinkle with fresh thyme leaves. When the beef is seared, remove from heat, cut off twine and smear lightly all over with Dijon mustard. Allow to cool slightly, then roll up in the duxelles covered prosciutto using the plastic wrap to tie it up nice and tight. Tuck in the ends of the prosciutto as you roll to completely encompass the beef. Roll it up tightly in plastic wrap and twist the ends to seal it completely and hold it in a nice log shape. Set in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to ensure it maintains its shape.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.
On a lightly floured surface, roll the puff pastry out to about a 1/4-inch thickness. Depending on the size of your sheets you may have to overlap 2 sheets and press them together. Remove beef from refrigerator and cut off plastic. Set the beef in the center of the pastry and fold over the longer sides, brushing with egg wash to seal. Trim ends if necessary then brush with egg wash and fold over to completely seal the beef - saving ends to use as a decoration on top if desired. Top with coarse sea salt. Place the beef seam side down on a baking sheet.
Brush the top of the pastry with egg wash then make a couple of slits in the top of the pastry using the tip of a paring knife ? this creates vents that will allow the steam to escape when cooking. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes until pastry is golden brown and beef registers 125 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Remove from oven and rest before cutting into thick slices. Garnish with minced chives, and serve with Green Peppercorn Sauce, Roasted Fingerling Potatoes with Fresh Herbs and Garlic, and Warm Wilted Winter Greens.
Green Peppercorn Sauce:
Add olive oil to pan after removing beef. Add shallots, garlic, and thyme; saute for 1 to 2 minutes, then, off heat, add brandy and flambe using a long kitchen match. After flame dies down, return to the heat, add stock and reduce by about half. Strain out solids, then add 2 cups cream and mustard. Reduce by half again, then shut off heat and add green peppercorns.
Roasted Fingerling Potatoes with Fresh Herbs and Garlic:
Preheat oven to 500 degrees F and place a baking sheet inside to heat.
Add potatoes, rosemary, sage, thyme, and garlic to a medium bowl. Drizzle with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Remove sheet pan from oven, lightly coat with olive oil, and pour potatoes onto pan. Place potatoes in oven and reduce heat to 425 degrees F. Roast for 20 minutes, or until crispy on outside and tender on inside.
Warm Wilted Winter Greens:
Cook honey and balsamic together over medium-high heat in a large saute pan, about 5 minutes. Toast walnuts in a small skillet; set aside to cool.
Pile greens on a platter. Stir mustard into balsamic-honey dressing, then whisk in about 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil; pour over greens. Season greens with salt and pepper and garnish with walnuts, pomegranate seeds, shavings of Parmesan, and shallot."

2,2,2,2,nice
2,2,2,2,"If you want to relax and you are interested into heavy machinery, then this game is for you. There is nothing like driving truck with a trailer carrying more than 20 tonnes of cargo while enjoying the beautiful scenery."
2,2,2,2,Great game! Much better than the first EuroTruck. A must have for who likes truck simulation games.
2,2,2,2,A great sequel!

2,2,2,2,Does exactly what it says on the tin. It is a truck sim and a damn good one
2,2,2,2,"You drive a truck. In Europe. It's the second one. It's called Euro Truck Simulator 2, what did you expect? 10/10 would crash into a car and do a barrel roll because physics"
2,2,2,2,omg this is the best 2nd trucking game
2,2,2,2,"Pretty fun game to play, but takes a lot to look good."

2,2,2,2,"trop bien



"
2,2,2,2,"Well worth your time and effort. This is the best truck sim available in my opinion 9/10. If you like this? Check out their other one American Truck Simulator, I got that one first, was so impressed I bought this one no question."
2,2,2,2,10/10 would play again.
2,2,2,2,I really like playing euro truck simulator 2 and i have 100 hours on it but when you have been on the base map for a long time you want to go somewhere else but you need to get dlc for those other countries but it isnt so expensive. The simulation on this game is AMAZING. and you can mod it! It also has a modded multiplayer wich I use myself sometimes.
2,2,2,2,"If you dont think you will like it, try it anyway. It is fun even to people who think driving trucks is stupid."
2,2,2,2,Best simulation game ever!
2,2,2,2,I'm addicted to this masterpiece! Can't wait for em to add Spain!
2,2,2,2,Amazing
2,2,2,2,"This game is just awesome. I'm going to add my music and just get driving some more. This game is seriously addictive!!! I still am yet to master the reverse, but I will do it one day!!!

I LOVE this game
