        "review": "Edit: I messaged support, and the problem was fixed. This is a really fun game and I definitely recommend it.\n\nI don't know whether to recommend or not. It's a really fun game, but even at the lowest settings, it has issues. My computer isn't top of the line, but it is fairly new, and it runs modern games at mid settings quite smoothly. It surpasses both the minimum and recommended requirements, so I'm sure that's not the problem. The game runs really well for about 20 minutes, and then it freezes and I have to close it down and reopen it, losing a bit of progress. This happens with no dlc, and it started before I had any mods installed. Idk why it's like this. The version on xbox game pass didn't do this at all, but I bought it on here earlier yesterday to use mods. I uninstalled the version on gamepass, and I even did a reset of my pc because I thought something was wrong with it. But even after reinstalling the game and resetting my computer, I'm still having this issue. If anyone has suggestions, please let me know.",

It\u2019s practically Minecraft if Minecraft was a city building game. Do anything, build a super high tech city full of skyscrapers, or build a small little town. Then connect the places in your city with roads, paths, buses, trains, planes and more, with no limits or suggestions, just free building. Watch your city grow from a place no one knows about to a Megacity with over 1 million people. Even little details like where people and cars are going are implemented. And if you get bored, despite all those features, there is a world full of mods made by the community. So, stop reading by review, go ahead and buy it right now!",

I do not know really how they could make this game better. They have made the game extremely mod friendly and many take advantage of that including myself. The developers might surprise us and come out with something better like a cities skylines 2, but...lol I feel like the only thing they can do is destroy the game like SimCity did with their new additions. Therefore my suggestion for the developers would be if you want to upgrade this game in any way. Just use mods. I own all but the music ones which do not interest me. That way they wont destroy the game and just continue to make it better if that is possible...lol....This is the best city building game on the market...Period. Please do not destroy that by coming out with a version 2 of this game... Just create mods.  With all that said... I cannot recommend this game enough if you like to build cities. There is a very large support community as well as many modders that support this game. But beware! Once you start building a city. You will be doomed and will become part of this community and you will live in your city. Life as you knew it will be over and your Sim life will begin.",

        "review": "Somewhere back in 2016 I bought cities skylines as it was back then a popular city builder game. After having played simcity i really got fascinated how paradox interactive reincarnated city simulator games. Today its been around 4 years since i have the game with on my account being 270+ hours and here is what i found good and bad about the game.\n\nTo start of I bought the game back in 2016 shortly before the snowfall DLC. With a 2012 Windows 8 computer I was capable to play the game until 2018. Somewhere around that time a DLC came out that finally terminated my computer from being able to cope with the game. In fact it didnt really matter if the city had a population of about 70000 or 3500 people. It was mostly because of mods and the new content that added up to the pile of slowing down my computer. I suppose that today the game wouldnt be still playable on a Windows 8 computer with all the mods off but thats only a suggestion i have on base of a trend that my pc was following when it came to performance. \n\nToday as I write this review I have a newer computer (Acer Nitro) I can say that the game is moving along with modern technology, newer and better computers. The game runs very smooth with minimal to no lag caused by graphics. However cities is in fact a game with plenty of AI that needs processing power and RAM to be able to function. Regarding assets I would suggest that 800 assets is about the best performance maximum you could get to run the game smoothly. Regarding mods I would stick with up to 30 active mods to not have the RAM start baking burgers.\n\nShortly said a few Pros and Cons are\n\nPros +:\nGame is up to date\nRealistic (well mostly in compared with other city builders)\nA huge diversity of assets and mods\nAn enormous community\nLow graphic usage\n\nCons -:\ndefinitively not a game for a 2012 computer or older\nthe addiction of adding more and more assets and mods causing the game to lose on performance (Steam Exclusive)\ngenerally a high RAM required (but that is because of mods and assets)\nA few features that are not included on the steam version that do appear on console (in my case the PS4)\n\nConclusion overall I still find Cities a game still worthy its content and diversity which has been implemented into the game. Therefor I do recommend it to friends and others that have a good taste for simulator games and a good computer.",

Reminds me of the old Rush Hour pack in Sim City 4 which I loved and it's expanded so far beyond it.  This game is much closer to the Sim City 5 that I was hoping for instead of the one that we got.  The only suggestion I have for developers is that they consider increasing some of the building limits for people with systems that can support it.  My very first major city that I started and I actually hit both the building limit and the node (Streets) limit.  Granted, the city was huge, but it limited it on adding a new building or adding a new sidewalk/path to my already huge city.  I understand the reason for the limits, but I think now that the game is several years old and computer CPU and GPU have advanced even further, it's time to expand on those limits a little more.  \nBut all in all, I absolutely love this game.",

        "review": "C:S is probably one of the games i have played the most, ever - look at my hour count for evidence. \n\nAnd i cannot help but notice every single flaw in it.\n\nThe description gives an idea. \"whilst expanding on some well-established tropes of the city building experience.\" The difference is - the game *utterly relies* on these tropes. Gameplay isn't deeper than, say, Simcity 2013 or Simcity 4 or Simcity 3K. It's the same sorta \"Just plug things in and make the numbers go up\" game.\n\nYou build police stations, crime goes down. You build schools, education goes up and people get richer and smarter. That's just the core gameplay loop. There's nothing deeper, no modeling of the trends and quirks of a city, no thought as to *why*  poor people are uneducated - it's just the Normal State of Things, unmoving as the borders of your city.\n\nThe constant expansion packs - expanding things that nobody has actually asked for - really just punctuate this. There's still a lot of flaws in the basegame - there's still disappearing cars, there's still traffic problems (just look at all the photos of cars lined up in a single lane) - and none of those have been addressed. Conversely, the DLC has only added things that nobody wanted. I don't think there was a single suggestion for Blimps, or Helicopters, or Radio. Even the ones that were asked for are added in a very half-assed way - Donoteat did a great teardown of Industries.\n\nThe game is decent at decorating, yeah, but performance during loading is ram-eating and horrific with a lot of mods. In addition, your modded city files are at constant risk of being bricked the moment C:O decides the game needs management of every individual toilet. Oh, and as a bit of a side-note - most content creators have mods which *actively disable* certain parts of the game - because it's so irritating otherwise.\n\nThe Launcher Fiasco just punctuates this. The game didn't need a launcher. I don't think anyone ever asked for a launcher. But nobody asks for 99% of the stuff C:O adds on for a premium, while suggestions from the very beginning of the game's life cycle remain unaddressed. Where's a better traffic simulation? Where's mixed-use buildings? Where's a vanilla way to get around the idiotic road angle requirements? WHERE'S VANILLA ELEVATED TRAIN STATIONS???\n\nOf course, the response is \"Let modders do it\". But at a certain level, you gotta face facts and admit your game is shit.",

        "review": "If you've ever played a citybuilder and been left wanting more, look no further. \n\nThis game can keep you building and maintaining your city for years. Real-life years. Mods and the epic modding community of Cities make it possible to build on as epic a scale as you like (that your machine can handle) on your own custom-designed map, creating your perfect city. The DLC is totally dependent on your personal taste; you can tailor the game to how you want to play it. Should you wish to build an epic city in the base game, you can! Tired of abandoned houses? Mod them out! Want to build a sprawling metropolis? Ditch the boundaries! The possibilities are endless right off the bat. \n\nThe downsides? Managing an entire city is A LOT. Both in real-life and in-game. Cities manages to compile a system that makes micromanaging possible, even more so with modded, however this can be a little daunting and very complicated without the help of streamers and YouTube guides. Most of the frustration comes from trying to figure out why a particular project isn't going the way you want it to, and is usually down to the way it's been built. However, if you're determined and willing to watch a couple of videos before/ whilst playing; you'll be rewarded with your very own fully functioning digital city. \n\nSide Note: The cherry on top, for me, would be a DLC/ modpack that changes the face of the game. For example; a steampunk-themed city. A medieval build. Many fantastic modellers have created some beautiful assets, however no-one's gunna re-skin an entire game's worth of assets on their own. Perhaps a suggestion if Paradox is ever thinking of a sequel?\n\nRight now, though, they don't need a sequel. This game satisfies that \"model train set\" urge. The desire to create something and watch it come to life.",

        "review": "Couldn't honestly recommend the game. It plays well and has an interesting slant to city building and management, but what content you don't get leaves a lot to be desired. The game was built over the course of a few years, a lot of it being based on player feedback and recommendations. They really did listen to the suggestions and a few mods were even incorporated straight into the game itself. Oh did I say Mods? Yeah this game has tons of them, and bottomless assets to really customize your city. There's tons of great graphic mods that make you feel like you're playing Sim City for adults. Sounds pretty good doesn't it? So what's the problem? \n\nWell about 2-3 updates in they decided to stop giving content away as \"updates\" and start charging for it as \"DLC\". Again, on the surface you wouldn't THINK this would be an issue if you're getting more content, until you start to look at what content you getting. It's stuff that should be included in the base game, but was cleverly omitted so they can charge you for it later. Let's go over a few. \n\nMass Transit: You FOR SURE need this DLC. If not, you're public transportation options are severely limited and city wide logistics turn into a nightmare after you hit a certain population density. It's just unplayabale. There are mods that help mitigate this but unfortunately the AI patches for path finding included in this are just too critical to base game to pass up. \n\nSnowfall: You literally don't get snow until you buy this update. On top of that, you can only have a snow map or not, it can't just snow in any map or not snow in a snow map. \n\nNatural Disasters: Just as the name implies. Weather is virtually nonexistent until you buy this update.\n\nIndustries: Probably the worst offender. Your options for \"industry\" before this update were limited to placing industry zones, and defining the type of industry within it. That's it. \n\nPractically all the DLC over $10 is certainly content that should be included in the base game. If you don't buy these, what you can do is essentially watered down to the point of \"Place this here. Okay you're done.\" It's just a let down to market as game as $30 only to quickly realize you're going to be spending $150 (and that's without the radio stations) to really play it.

Not only allows players to develop their personal creative ability, but also test the player's care and patience.\nOf course, the shortcomings can not be ignored: 1. The game's memory and graphics card requirements are actually very high, if you want to experience the game effect on the network video, my suggestion is that you have a very high configuration computer. 2. The game compatibility is very poor. The mods of many creative workshops produced by the players are not very compatible. I don't know if the game itself is designed or the loopholes. I hope all the good mods are compatible, and the front mods are compatible. It is too much, I hope that when the game is updated, I can try to put the mod into the game content. 3. The game needs to buy a lot of Dlc, if you can't buy it, you can't experience a lot of game content. This is actually a change to the price of the game, and I think the effect of the update is actually very small.\n",

        "review": "One of the best city builders which I played in my life.\n\nThere are nearly no limits how you want to play your game. It is extremely enjoyable, even more with mods, but if you want to unlock everything in a legitimate way you will need to give it some time and plan your gameplay well in order to unlock the unique buildings, etc.\n\nI do not own all DLCs. They are too expensive to buy all at the same time. You should better buy the game and DLC's when it is reduced. Unfortunately, the discounts only from time to time go lower than -50%. Sometimes you can buy something for -66%, but it won't be any of the newer DLC's.\n\nGraphics are great, you can zoom it and enjoy the really detailed view of the city (I would recommend doing it at night what makes this game looking just beautiful - you will need Afterdark DLC though - highly recommended regardless of cosmetics as it adds tons of content to the game).\n\nYou can play it well on relatively old PC, even older laptop with dedicated graphics should make it (lowering details is highly recommended). Even dedicated budget laptop cards (like GeForce MX150) can do well, but I would recommend at least the 4 core CPU. \n\nThe only real problem I encountered and which is really annoying is the management of deceased citizens, what can make your life really hard when your city is big enough (I would say it can be difficult for new player over 50,000 citizens and without smart decisions it is a real challenge when your city grows over 150,000). There are the ways to overcame it of course, but you will learn it with getting more experienced.\n\nSimilar problem applies to garbage collection but it is muuuuch easier to fix, expecially with Green Cities DLC (or mods).\n\nI would add some content to it as there are some aspects that could be done better - more buildings! - but Steam workshop provides dozens of addons for free. If would be nice if Paradox made use of gamers suggestions (and mods ideas) to add content to their game for free or at least cheaper than usual.\n\nThe game is extremely enjoyable and the more time you spend with it the more you understand it and every new city you build is more complex and governed better.\n\nRegardless of some issues, I can honestly give this game 10/10 in city builder category (8,5/10) for every other gamer, especially strategy fans.",

Have you ever had to think about where your waste water is going? Whether or not it is downstream from your freshwater source? How far away those wind turbines are from the rest of the city and how much noise pollution they create? What about how industrial zones close to residential areas slowly deteriorate the quality of health in that neighborhood?\nLearning these as I played were frustrating in the most fun ways.\n\nAnd yet, sometimes it isn't always that fun when big problems arise. What happens when you find out nobody is working in this new commercial zone when you have plenty of workers and empty office buildings? Probably because you don't have enough schools to create educated workers in that area. What happens when everyone is suddenly getting sick, with no clear cause in site? Maybe because you accidentally connected one pipe wrong, and now the waste water is mixing with the drinking water.\nThe game rarely tells you if you are screwing up, nor does it provide any suggestions for solutions, making it a largely \"learn by doing\" or \"learn by asking your friends\" kind of game.\nPersonally, I don't mind it. In fact, I think it adds to the fun mystique of a city builder, but I think it is worth mentioning to you, reader, in the event it doesn't thrill you.\n\nThe game still hasn't quite gotten that stale for me. The DLC is mad expensive, and I don't know if it will ever be worth it, but the core game is excellent.",

        "review": "Good game overall.  Scratches the city builder itch that I get every now and then.  Definitely better than any other option on the market right now.  This tiny little game studio made monolithic EA eat humble pie and Colossal Order deserves significant praise for making a game that consumers actually wanted to play rather than what some clueless nitwit in an suit told them to make.\n\nThe only real nitpick I have with this game is that the traffic AI has some annoying issues that force you to game the system rather than build realistically sometimes.  I've been hoping to see them fix it but its been so long now that I have to assume they aren't going to.  Still fun to play but when your city gets large it can start getting crazy with the traffic to a very unrealistic degree because of nonsensical AI pathing.  I don't know about anyone else but I play city builders to build realistic cities, not to build cities that game a bad AI.  It is the most glaring flaw of the game which is rather perplexing since this is the same studio that made the Cities in Motion traffic simulation games.  If there is one thing Colossal Order should have down by now, it is simulated traffic.  It is an absolute shame it hasn't been corrected since otherwise Cities: Skylines is a stellar game. \n\nThis is a game published by Paradox Interactive which means DLCs.  Lots of them.  This is a love/hate thing for me.  I'm a pretty big Paradox game fan and I love their commitment to continued support for these games years after release but the DLCs are often overpriced for what you get, especially at release. Paradox DLCs are definitely worth buying, just not at the price point Paradox seems to think they are worth.  This is totally on Paradox Interactive, not Colossal Order.  Because DLCs are so frequent with Paradox games, it can get daunting to buy them all as a newcomer.  The Cities: Skylines base game is great on its own so my suggestion is to buy the extras when they go on sale.  Sales happen often on Paradox games between steam, legit online retailers that provide steam keys, and the Paradox website so just wait for one to grab up the extra content packs.\n\nArbitrary score card from 1 to 5 (5 being best):\nPrice: base game 4 / DLCs 2\nFeatures: 4\nEase of play: 4\nReplayability: 5\nGraphics: 4 (for a city builder)\nMusic: 3\n\n",

One suggestion i would make would be to include the first person view as a default option instead of from a mod and to have mini missions like stopping a robber after he's robbed someones purse.  City building is fun but it would make it a much better game.   Not sure I agree with so many dlc's.  The game works out quite expensive once you've purchased the same basic funcionality as simicity through paradox's mods like natural disasters.  I think game developers flunk in the market because games have such high prices.  People just don't have that sort of money to spend on pretty pictures on their screens.  As far as city builders go though i'd say this could be good if they made a cheaper version of their dlc addons as a pack or a season pass to include dlc's.",

Oh, and I bought the After Dark expansion, as well. \n\nBut I will ask for a few things from Colossal Order:\n\nMixed-use zoning (within one building), please? I have friends on a blog who mentioned C:S in a post, giving it kudos for in-detail management of public transport, but wished that mixed-use zoning was an option. I would be absolutely thrilled if Colossal Order went further and allowed users to notate the proportion of floors dedicated to a specific use (residential, commercial/retail, office, hospitality). \n\nBike lanes? I would really like to see both bike trails and (not mixed traffic) on-street bike lanes as options. \nAnd maybe the option for a trail with a built-in tree and/or green space buffer, with the option to make it elevated, like the High Line in New York?\n\nMore street layout options? For example, 1 lane per direction for buses only (exclusive street), and contra-flow bus lane(s) on a one-way street? And maybe streets with dedicated transit lanes for both buses and trams to utilize, with passing lanes for transit vehicles not stopping? \n\nMetro stations with in-station transfers (so, stations with space for 2 or more lines to have their own 2 tracks) ? \nAnd maybe the option to have multiple entrances to a Metro station?\n\nUnderground electricity lines?\n\nOption to connect railway stations with Metro stations for a free transfer?\n\nUnderground railway stations for city centers?\n\nRailway stations with 2 middle tracks for trains passing through to bypass trains stopped at platforms?\n\nOption to designate districts and/or neighborhoods as 24/7 centers of activity, such as entertainment, retail, bars, etc?\n\nAbility to charge a congestion/cordon fee for entering certain neighborhoods in a motor vehicle, like London (UK) does? \n\n\nJust some suggestions that would make for a truly walkable, bikeable, and transit-friendly city. \n",

Other than that, when it comes to disasters, Cities Skylines is bone dry.\n\n4/10\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDeveloper Involvement\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe devs of Cities Skylines are wide open to suggestion and feedback on the game, they give good feedback to community creations, and they are all ears on social media.\n\n10/10\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMusic\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe soundtrack in Cities Skylines is beautiful, it's not overwhelming, and it adds a nice feel to the game that makes you feel like you really are building a city.\n\n9/10\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFINAL SCORE FOR CITIES SKYLINES:\n\n84/100\n\nVery good game, I'd recommend it to any city builder fan.",

All of which are mental hospitals. =D\n\nEDIT!!!: The game has gotten a few expansion packs. They are both fantastic and totally worth the money.",

Anyways, a slew of bad reviews and ratings kept me away from buying that game, and after learning how restrictive that game was, I decided against ever buying it.\n\nSo there I was looking for an alternative to a city building sim. There weren't many and the few that existed weren't that great. With the release of Cities: Skylines that all changed.\n\nIf you guys remember Sim City 4 and all it's glory, Cities: Skylines is pretty much that and more. It has a huge modding community that have done a wonderful job sharing their creations and tools with all of us (seriously guys I can't thank you enough : ) ). Other than that, this game is about as good as you can get with a city building sim. On top of that the developers are very active and are listening to their playerbase for suggestions and everything, And I see that as a huge plus. One bummer is that you can't unleash natural disasters on your city but ohh wellllll.\n\nI give this 9 goofy tweeters out of 10. Seriously, get this if you're a veteran of the Sim City series and are looking into getting the latest city builder sim. You. Will. Not. Regret. a. Thing...except putting more of your alotted time into this than you have. ;)",

You guys have said so much of the advantages, I would like to talk some disadvantages.\n1.Traffix: built in traffic control systems is not intelligent enough, for instance when you have a motorway exit it must be a single lane to avoid \"unnatural\" lane switch caused jam, if you want to have a two lane exit or three lane exit, you would have to rely on T++ to \"teach the\" the traffic system how to switch lanes reasonablily.\n2.power and water supply is boring, you must drag silly pipes one by one to ensure water supply and build wires to power the city which does not make sense. Why not supply water and power once a power station is connected to roads like it works in Sim city? If you would like to make it serious and  reasonable please add some sewage system building functions with considering terrains and introduce sewage flow mechanism just like build ground/underground traffic system.\n3. Pollution treatment: you could build skyscrapers and hi tech factories, but there are no recycle centres or sewage treatment plant. You cannot put the garbage car centres far from your city since they have limited coverage areas.If you would like to build Green cities, congrats: not possible.\n4. Additional suggestions: \ndisasters such as unclear power plant explosion is achievable.\nYet jails introduced, police is just silly as it looks, learn from fire engine please.",

        "review": "After 150+ hours on this game (I know embarrassing) I think a few things are worth pointing out for people still on the fence.  I was someone who loved the late Sim City remake.  Don\u2019t get me wrong it certainly had its problems especially when considering things such as size and scope and the debacle that was online only gameplay.  Sim City also came with the normal hooks we\u2019ve become accustom to with most EA titles.  That being said I found the core elements of Sim City to be quite fun and once you got used to playing within the restrictions that it demanded it was a very fun game.\n\nWhy did I just yammer about Sim City on a skylines review?  It seemed necessary because Cities Skylines will immediately feel a lot like Sim City.  My actual immediate first impression of Skylines was it felt as if the designers played and loved Sim City.  They then sat around reading all of the comment and forum boards that were undoubtedly exploding with complaints and suggestions for improvements.  They then took all of the most common threads and built a new Sim City that addressed all of the popular issues.\n\nCities Skylines lets you build huge cities, gives you a ton more flexibility than Sim City and the presence of Steam Workshop only furthers the experience.  The development team\u2019s experience from Cities in Motion shines through as the transportation system works great as well.   Especially when you consider the price point and the fact that its developers have been great in working with the game community it is in my mind a no doubt buy.  However, I figured I should also talk about the less amazing parts of the game as well.\n\nDespite all the above mentioned great things the game does a few minor sore spots stick out.  Agriculture (without steam workshop) seems a bit off.  The agriculture zones the same exact way any other zone works.  So instead of having massive farms like you would expect to see (and what you might be accustom to from say Sim City 4) you do not get this.  Instead you get agriculture buildings that rise like those in the heavy industry sectors accompanied by small 4x4 farms.  Keep in mind the game was developed by Europeans so for American gamers the farms (again without workshop items) have a European flare instead of what you might see in say Texas/Kansas/etc.  Not that this is a bad thing mind you, just something to be aware of before jumping in.  \nAnother point worth mentioning, without mincing words\u2026 tourism doesn\u2019t work well in this game.  Don\u2019t get me wrong the game has all the staples built in, landmarks, airports, stadiums, etc.  However, in a city with well over 100,000 people, an intl airport, train connection, etc sometimes I could still only manage around 200 tourists.  This aspect of the game is a far cry from the fun you might recall having when building say a tourist city in Sim City.  This is by no means a game breaker, but a bit of a disappointment and something I imagine will eventually get addressed by devs.  It is worth mentioning that there are tourism mods floating around as well.  \nLastly and this is probably the biggest issue.  After playing a fair share of this game there is just something missing.  For all the shortcomings that Sim City had, all the frustrations, the limitations, Sim City had a tremendous amount of character.  From the plopable buildings that were customizable to the distinct art theme, for me Sim City always felt like you were building a personalized City that was entirely yours.  Yes cities were frustratingly small and yes, eventually you had so many people living in a city traffic was a complete nightmare, but none of these things took away from the personal relationship Sim City built with its players.  For some reason and I\u2019m not sure I can even explain why, Cities Skylines just doesn\u2019t build this kind of relationship with the player.  While cities are gigantic they seem very mechanical, and while the small cities of Sim Cities made it easier to overlook a limited number of building styles, it\u2019s harder to ignore in Skylines.  When you have a gigantic city and all the lights turn on and off at the same time across hundreds of buildings and you see the same building over a dozen times in a sprawling city it does hurt the overall experience.  Again, not game breaking problems and yes many of these issues can be addressed with Steam workshop issues, but I figured I just throw my two cents in.  \nIn general I find Skyline and its expansion pack to be very satisfying games.  I would still recommend it over Sim City, but not without mentioning some of the above items.  If you\u2019re just jumping in now, know that the folks at Colossal Order are doing a great job staying both connected with the game community as well as supporting the game with continuous updates and patches.  Don\u2019t hesitate to buy this game if you think you might like it, but just know it\u2019s not perfect (like anything else).  \n",

        "review": "It took years of waiting, but now thanks to the folks at Colossal Order we have the modern and innovative city builder known as Cities Skylines.\n\nWhat I like:\n- The game is everything that Simcity 2013 should have been and better. To top it all off, it's only $30 (half what Simcity was at launch!)\n\n- The maps are huge. You start on one 2x2km tile (similar to what you got in Simcity), but you have the ability to purchase up to 9 tiles (25 with mods) and you can acquire more land fairly early on in the game.\n\n- Ability to designate specific lines for your buses, subways, and trains to follow instead of having them go all over the place like in Simcity.\n\n- An innovative road construction system. You have a variety of different road types at your disposal, and the game engine has the capability of making some pretty seamless transitions and interesctions. My favourite feature has to be the way you draw highways. Highways are treated as a 3 lane one-way road, and there's a separate onramp/offramp tool. For those who are particularly inclined, you have the potential to make some pretty crazy interchanges.\n\n- Mod support. There's already a large number of fantastic mods available already, and given time they will only get better! If there's a feature that you feel is missing from the base game, you can either get it from the Steam Workshop, or make it yourself!\n\nWhat needs improvement/Suggestions for future additions:\n- Better options for transferring between transit lines, especially for metros. As it stands right now metro stations can only support one tunnel going in two directions. It would be nice to be able to have the ability to transfer between two perpendicular lines in one metro station.\n\n- There's no vanilla teraforming tool. Yes there is a mod that adds one, but it would have been nicer if the developer had made it from the start.\n\n- Road variety is awesome as it is, but there are so many things they could have added. For example, highways with different numbers of lanes (i.e. 2 lanes each direction, 4-5 lanes each direction, etc.)\n\n- One thing I'd really like to see is more modular transport buildings (i.e. multi-track train station, bus terminal, ability to add more terminals/runways on airports, etc).\n\n- There could be more transport options as well (i.e. above ground metro, streetcars, monorail, maglev, etc).\n\nOverall:\n\nThis game is worth the money. They somehow managed to strike a perfect balance for just about everything. The game has a quick enough learning curve that it's forgiving for a beginner, but at the same time it's challenging enough for a seasoned city builder. If you're a fan of city builder games, there's no reason why you shouldn't buy this game!",

There are parts where competitors outshine this, but if the devs add these bits in, then it can and will be the perfect city sim..\n\nNegatives/improvment suggestions;\n[list]\n[*]No air polution currently in game.\n[*]Weather/wind/day/night not changable. Static. I'd love to see my City at night.\n[*]If the above was ever implimented, then being able to 'zone' streetlights etc would be great - but this is obviously a small 'want'\n[*]Trees do not seem to help clear ground pollution\n[*]Tree placement needs more options, such as the zoning 'brush' or line drawing like roads. Being able to select multiple types at once would be nice too.\n[*]Traffic can be buggy. Not SimCity buggy, but emergancy vehicles will often sit in traffic instead of going around them.\n[*]No tunnels (Yet. Apparently due to come with an update)\n[*]Ability to select zone types would be welcome to help create more controlled districts. Perhaps an update to the district tool could solve this? eg - commercial zones types. I often get 20 donut shops in a row. Being able to say \"This is an \"electrical area\" or \"Retail\" area would create diversity amonsgt shops. Additional types should also be applied to Industry to allow cleaner industry/more diverse industry (Electrical, Manufactoring etc).\n[*]Building 'themes' . Related to above, but would be nice to set themes of buildings. I often get a chinese style home amoung european buildings or US buildings and it breaks the flow. Being able to set a theme could also work for commercial areas (say, set type =food/retail, theme = chinese, creat a mini china town)\n[*]Pedestrian only areas for shops/houses using the path tool would be welcome - at present buildings can only be placed along roads. Many city centres revolve around pedestrian only access (certainly in the UK), so being able to place zones along paths could create better environments.\n[*]Car parks - Park and Ride (Transport menu?) and Commercial/Retail (would work well with the above)\n[*]More information for transport network - ie, est.route time and effiency\n[*]Farms need improving - I'd love to see the farming zones resemble the farming zones as found in Cities XL. Farms reside on large fields, and the ones currently in game are all small polts situated against roads. You can't really create a rural area as such.\n[/list]\n\nI'm sure I could think of other suggestions, but they are the bulk of what I feel is missing currently.  Mods can probably rectify a few of these (I've see better transport/road info mods, and to some extent, car parks) but these need to be standard features and need to be controllable where they operate.\n\nOverall, I am extremely impressed with what the team have done thus far, and can only hope future updates bring in additional features to make this the perfect City Simulator. \n\nDon't hesitate to pick this up! It's EXTREMELY cheap (I even got 20% off at GMG), and if you even remotely like City Building games, this will not fail to impress you.",

We could use more alerts that our utilities are nearing capacity or suggestions on how to alleviate traffic, or design efficient mass transit.\n\nThe game is extremely forgiving and encourages iterating.

Things YOU place should have construction times which would make you have to plan ahead. When something unexpected happens that you didnt' plan for, you should be punished. You forgot to put a cemetary down and dead people are piling up? Well it will take some game time for your new cemetary to be made. Same goes with electricity and water shortages and so forth.

        "review": "--Initial review at 19.1 hours--\n\nCities: Skylines has given me a great experience so far. Simply put, it's like Sim City if a bunch of corporate wigs didn't tell the developers \"This is what people want in a city sim, and this is how we're telling you to make it\"\n\nIt's well thought out, there is attention to detail, and is a welcome new addition to the city sim genre.\n\nThat being said, it isn't perfect.\n\nPros: \n-Well thought out game mechanics\n-The ability to draw out districts and enact policies in both specific districts and overall city policy.\n-Nice attention to detail with emergency services. As a person involved in the fire service, it's nice seeing that a firetruck in game doesn't just pull up and start shooting water at the building. One or two will show up, a few firemen get out of each and either run into the building or stand near the trucks and get hoses set up, and then the water will start flowing. It's not really important overall, but it's an appreciated detail.\n-Diverse power grid options ranging from coal and oil to solar, two kinds of wind, and hydroelectric. The only addition to that list that I'd like to see is some form of hydrogen power source.\n-Makes fun of Sim City in many ways, including achievement names, base city size, and other things.\n-Zoning is easy and has a layer of customization to it.\n\nCons:\n-There appears to be a self-zoning bug of some sort. I have tried to dezone an area between two roads but it keeps rezoning itself to low-density commercial.\n-The game doesn't always provide clear feedback to what an issue is and how to resolve it. Some issues are fairly simple to trouble shoot, but currently my city is having an issue with a lack of buyers of products from my industrial buildings, but there is no industrial, commercial, or residential demand.\n-The game takes a bit of patience to learn. It took me five or six tries before I created a successful city.\n-Some of the requirements for the unique buildings are counter-productive. Some ask you to have an obsurd number of abandoned buildings present in your city or to have a certain number of sick citizens. Compared to the other requirements like having three filled cemetaries, doing well in this sector, that sector, et cetera, those requirements are backwards and the negative concequences outway the good of unlocking the unique building. It's counter intuitive.\n-No day-night cycle.\n\nSuggestions:\n-It would be nice to see a few more types of unique buildings or a rework of the requirements to unlocking the existing ones.\n-After a certain amount of time has passed for you to get your city up and running, it would be nice to see the introduction of emergencies, disasters, and other events occur that you must deal with. Perhaps things from hurricanes, snowstorms, riots, to water pipes bursting and such, et cetera. It would also allow for new polcies to be added such as putting your city into a state of emergency, curfews, gun control, citizens must shovel their portion of sidewalk during snow storms (Save money, decrease happiness), and more.\n-Perhaps a new utility being created for the road department. Street sweepers can help reduce ground polution, roads can degrade and you'll have to spend money to keep them maintained from pot holes and such, if snowstorms are added then snowplows would be important.\n-Adding the homeless could be interesting. Increased crime rates in areas they squat. You could combat that by building shelters, soup kitchens, or outlawing homelessness if you're feeling particularly evil.\n-It would be nice if parks didn't have to be placed right along a road, so you could put a playground in the middle of a bunch of high rises and have walking paths leading to them.\n-Perhaps adding a mayor's office that could be upgraded to allow for certain buffs or allow citizens to come to you with city propositions, requests, and complaints.\n\nAt this point in time, I'd give this game an 8/10. It's very well made, but there's a lot of room for improvement. After a decent amount of time, there's not much residential, industrial, or commercial demand and the challenge wears off.\n\nIf you have the money to spare, I'd say that you should buy this game at it's full price or wait for a sale.\n",

The last city-builder I purchased had so many buttons to figure out how to play it, I got too bored after 30 minutes not knowing what to do and so I deleted it and never tried again. With Cities: Skylines, however, I had no problem figuring out what to do. Took me a few re-do attempts to spend my money on the right stuff starting off, but after that it was a cruise! \n\nI love how this game lets the player control so many things in the city budget, and zone districts, and truly be in control of how the city matures. I also like the progress rate of the game. Not too fast, not too slow. \n\n***MOST OF ALL*** I was so entertained by the game that I lost track of time. Not too many games can make me lose track of time. I started playing around 6pm and the next thing I knew it was 4am. WHOA. Where'd the time go?! That's how you know you're having fun. I quit bad games really fast, and if a game has something I don't like right at the get-go, I won't even give the rest of the game a chance, I just uninstall immediately. Obviously that didn't happen with this game haha. \n\nSuggestions: \n-Make a day/night cycle\n-Offer a service for $2/month to provide in-game live support for help when players are having trouble with their city and need advice\n-Need more trees and landscaping. No gardens?\n-Would be awesome to have events, like Super Bowl in my city every few years. Make it dynamic, increased traffic, increased sales, hotel rooms booked, temporary fan shops, etc. City wide events would be great\n-Make the f-stop on the virtual camera less narrow\n\nMore suggestions coming (eventually)",

        "review": "By far the best city builder I've ever played. The level of detail in every part of this game is stunning. Every person is simulated, and you can watch as they go through their day and drive around your city/use public transport to go to work, home, or shopping, or just visit various landmarks around your city. You can even watch as fire fighters are dispatched from a fire house to put out a fire, as EMS is dispatched to help an injured person, or as police are sent out to patrol or investigate a crime. Your industry can send out trucks to supply your commercial district with products to be bought by your residents, or export it through highways or train stations. Although traffic management can take some time to get used to, you have a large amount of control over how your city flows and operates, and what kind of buildings are built in your city. The graphics for this game are much better than they first appear, and I high recommend getting the 1st person camera mod to get a good experience. Even in a large city with countless cars and sims being simulated, this game has run flawless for me so far, with a medium end computer (GTX 560 Ti/Intel i5 2400). The modding potential is also huge for this game, featuring great mod support and tons of community content, even only 3 days after release. My only major suggestion for this game would be the addition of dynamic events (Such as casino contracts/toxic waste facilites), but there is still plenty to do without that! This game has far more value than most $60 games, so $30 is an amazing price. There are plenty of twitch streams and youtube videos displaying this game that I highly recommend watching if you are still unsure!",

Cities Skylines foundations are solid and the game was developed with one eye in allowing content to be provided by the community and another to be built upon by the developers. By the, the developers (Colossal Order - a bunch of crazy, highly passionate Finns) and the publisher (Paradox) have been super open and transparent with the community (check Reddit and Paradox Plaza), there are open channels of communication with the actual developers and they do listen to suggestions and feedback. Looking forward for hours and years of entertainement!",
