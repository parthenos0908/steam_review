I was just wondering how long into the game do you guys feel it gets a little boring? And are there good mods that could alter game play enough to enhance the replay value? \n\nSecondly everyone talks about making the most efficient factories, are there multiple ways or \"setups' to be used to achieve the same level of efficiency of others builds?  I guess my point being is there enough room for creativity to the point where there is multiple ways to achieve the same goal. \n\nLastly how friendly is the learning curve to newer players? I don't have allot of time to just sit down and watch/read tutorials. I was hoping that I could jump on for a few hours and try to improve my builds or factories and there being enough things to do that will keep me interested. Hope you guys could help me out.\n\nAnd yes I played the demo but still just want the opinions of people who own the game.",

        "comment": "I'm always interested in how fast it'd be possible to complete a run in factorio, at least theoretically.\n\nThe biggest friction right now in runs are operator actions per minute(APM).  \n\nSomeone posted a computer enhanced run, it was about 1 hour and 21 minutes (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYIplmAQcWU&t=3464s), faster than the current record of 1:27 (https://www.speedrun.com/factorio/run/z1rwkw9m).  The tool assisted run(TAR) wasn't that well planned out, IMHO, but I get it - scripting a computer to do a run is probably a nightmare.  The human one is exceedingly well planned out, but APM still rules over planning.\n\nAnother way to do it is via the creative mod.  I use blueprints, but climbing the tech tree is required.  As this is theoretical, I think having unlimited inventory (except for intermediates) is fine.  I also use unlimited reach and insta construction.\n\nThe idea really is to figure out if some ideas are missing from the current plans and running around (at least for me) just distracts from that goal.\n\nNot a big surprise - I am able to beat the TAR with something rough.  It's still rather messy and I'm cleaning it up as I go along and I'm pretty sure I can do much better.  Right now I'm finding the biggest way to improve times is increase base production earlier (steel, green circuits, copper, iron).\n\nOne thing on my to do list is to rework the blueprints with an eye for how a human would lay it out in a real run.  \n\nAnother useful thing about this approach is they make for shorter games.  I don't have the same time to spend on factorio I used to.",

I had a lot of fun playing, modding, single, multi, basically, I know the game and I like it very much. But there is one problem, which bothers me, always did, and probably will in the future, I want to talk about end-game, late late game. I feel like this game has such a great potential to be the best game ever created, but the game engine is holding it back, every time you start a new game you already know you will not be able to play past some point. This makes me very sad, and sometimes I just don't even start. What is the point spending 300hrs on a save, when there is only one thing, which is 100% going to happen, and it's reaching the roof. Already when creating a new world I can tell you when it is going to end. I know that the game cannot be simply turned to multithreaded, but it would make me feel a lot better if I knew there was something going on behind the scenes to enhance the performance. I don't know guys how do you fell about this, and if you ever created a mega-base, but for me, it has become tiring, when you cannot just do what you want and instead you need to calculate the best UPS efficient methods in order to make your games last longer. It kills the creativity and in the end the fun. I really hope the only solution to this problem is not i9-999999999K at 50GHz. Let me know what do you think, cheers <3\n",

This makes me feel that there's a missing piece here. It has come up time and time again with many suggestions but from what I've read, they come up with new things you can place in your factory rather than pieces you can assemble into something you want.

I've also experienced other crashes, and my long-running game has become unplayable. Recently I had a very bad crash when clicking on an item in a Spidertron equipment grid, and the game would not start at all, aafter something like 40+ tries. I deleted Factorio and my user folder (after making backups), downloaded the 1.1.39 installer, and started from scratch. Same results, had to try a bunch of times to even get to the main menu. Eventually I was able to make a new sandbox game, which crashed when I saved it. Factorio was solid and reliable up through 1.1.38, and now it's a disaster for me. Please help!",

Select the copy tool.\n3. Hold down shift while creating a blueprint that includes transport belts.\n4. Click \"Create blueprint\".\n5. Select the paste tool.\n\nExpected result: Paste tool is missing transport belts.\n\nActual result: Paste tool has transport belts.\n\n\nThe other ways of creating blueprints all work as expected, the belts are gone:\nCopy tool without shift\nBlueprint tool with shift\nBlueprint tool without shift",

I can change it in the interface, and can save the blueprint with the change, and when I go back to the blueprint, it's updated. But when I go to place the blueprint in the world, it's still using absolute positioning. Once I place it ONCE with absolute positioning, then it starts using relative positioning. Persists through saves, and only happens to one blueprint.\n\nSteps to reproduce in attached save file:\n1. Load save\n2. Try placing currently selected blueprint (named \"20.96 MW Solar\", inside blueprint book \"IR\")\n3.

I've attached the .zip file that generated during the event.\n\nHardware/Network Config: I am not fully aware of the host's hardware or network config. However, the host has a relatively unstable connection (satellite internet). Downloading a ~25MB map takes about 5 minutes at around 100KB/s. My hardware config (client side) is in my forum signature.\n\nContext for desync: I am joining a game that has been hosted by a single player for a long stretch of uptime. Currently I am the only one on the server except for the host, who has been AFK for hours. The map was created since before 1.0. The desync occurred after I uploaded a blueprint containing a train and train stop with config to game blueprints, and then tried to stamp it on top of an existing train/train stop. I tried reconnecting and doing this again and I was able to reproduce the desync by performing the same action. After manually removing the train and train stop, I was able to place the blueprint without issue. My best guess is that pasting the settings on top of the train or station is what caused the desync.\n\nIn case the forum attachments don't work, here is a mediafire link:\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/m1a73lmk ... 1.zip/file\n\nHope this helps!",

I use Production and Electric network info charts regularly, especially to check trends and look for unexpected dips. It is also extremely helpful to use the graphs to watch if final products closely follow intermediate product production trends (do they go up and down together). My complaint is that if I click on a single resource, the graph automatically \"highlights\" [only] that resource but ALSO changes the scale and line color (if not first resource that is blue) so you lose the immediate point of reference relative to other products that were previously showing on the graph. Thus, selecting the resource(s) by itself is an unsatisfactory work-around.\n\nPlease make it so that when you hover over a resource icon/button that it also highlights the corresponding line in the graph at the same time as the icon/button is highlighted in the table.",

It is indeed heavy and we run Global Tick Time Scale at 30UPS to free up CPU so all computers involved can play smoothly and lag-free.\n\nWhen closing down the game, we have taken into habit to pause the game, because the server setting does not carry out the pausing in a good fashion. If we forget this or is dropped, we are left to painfully slow joining times.\n\nThe setting makes it do pause the game after all have left, but, it does not keep the game paused until the first player have loaded the map. It instead unpauses the game directly when someone is downloading the map. When playing with such huge maps it adds several extra minutes in catching-up time. We are already talking minutes in just loading the map, so this behaviour makes the client be very far behind the server when the loading is done and it starts catching up. It do also contribute to disconnect errors since the server is running away from a joining client. More of that in another report.\n\nWhat the game properly should do, is that it should wait with unpausing until the first client are ready, meaning when the map are loaded and the client can join directly without catching up.

After many hours of gameplay, I found what can make game more engaging.\n   I found that if you play Factorio in peaceful mode as base builder, there's many repetetive \n   Craft schemes, for example on contrary [heavy oil] and [light oil]  production chains are one of most\n   interesting game craft schemes. because if player want that these chains exist effectively, he must think out a very coherent\n   chain system, wich very exististence is based on each other, like in true life. Of course game is crafted to  best with war element.\n   So does reducing game to peaceful builder is also price for less rich gameplay ? good question.\n\n  Despite this question, correct formula of good PC game is to give player most logical crafting freedom, which cyber framework can provide.\nMore possibilites game have, more unique gameplays can occur, and  this is how best game is can be definated. Chess&Go is ultimate of current \n  know  games in planet, because they have most of possibilites in logical , harmonical game framework.\n\n\n  So My Vision is to give game ability to rule electrical energy more freely.\n\n     * electrical energy current can be manualy reigned to game transporting&constructing elements. \n     * Increasing electrical current increases efficiency of game dynamical elements. \n     * Increased efficiancy due e.current increases Temperature.\n     * Integrate Real Time Thermodynamics in game , which will allow to lay down water flow systems around elements in order to absorb and allocate heat.\n     * Make water flow system more rich, integrating pipe elements wich can hold water in heat until it can transfrom to steams. this is how you can make \n       more efficiant systems, wich will allow player to use output of thermol energy back to system ( Like Formula - 1). \n     * This is also gonna make player more cautions due the possibility of overheating consequences.\n\n  --- SO because if such integrations, Game will have not only possibilty to build multiply core schematic system base ( due limitations of belts) , but also you can make infinitly smart huge crafting cores, with devoloping heat >water > steam > energy system around such huge cores. \n\n\n    So if you lover of Objective Reasoning , you will agree that his  power&thermo gameplay enrichment will be not game changing, not game imbalancing, \n    but just very enriching and giving more    possibilites to build your base.

A negative limit could be used to signal \"may skip\" allowing this to be activated via circuit network and wouldn't even need any GUI work.\n2) In the train schedule add an icon after the station name that can be toggled on or off. The icon would say weather to skip the station when destination full. This would be more work and I'm not sure of it's usefulness over option 1.\nWhy ?\nThe ability to skip stations in the schedule is an often requested feature. In a very limited way one can use the enable/disable station feature. But that is limited to one train at a time and constructing a station with enable/disable feature for multiple trains is possible but it involves a dummy train stop per train and complex circuit logic that is beyond most players. Being able to combine skipping stations with the train station limits would open up a lot more options.",

So it's easy to make a big central circuit network and at the same time one can also make small local networks.",

        "comment": "TL;DR\nEnhance locale system to support dialects which differ from full languages by having a parent language to fall back on if not overridden.\nWhat ?\nInstead of just having an en/ locale directory for English, have that, but also allow subdirectories for dialects of the language, such as American English, British English, Australian English, etc.  These dialects will not have entries for most things, because they will match the generic English language.  But they will have the option of overriding a few key words or phrases only where the dialects diverge.  For languages that may lack full localisations, especially in mods, they can use a similar system to specify a language to fall back on that is likely to be at least somewhat mutually intelligible.\nWhy ?\nMaintaining an entire new locale for every dialect of every supported language is probably untenable, especially for mods which often only support one or a few languages.  By allowing a heirarchy of backup localisations, it's unnecessary to maintain that level of support.  This may be even more useful for certain other languages like Latin American Spanish vs. European Spanish than for the example of English listed above.  For English, the dialects are all mutually comprehensible, but are nevertheless a consistent source of annoyance in mods that make use of words that differ between them  (e.g. aluminium/aluminum, color/colour).  An example where it might be helpful for an incomplete language to fall back on another might be Norwegian, which the Crowdin page lists as incomplete.  A lot of it is either the same as the Swedish localization or is more or less mutually intelligible, so it could fall back on Swedish as a default until complete.  And even when complete in the base game it might still be a good option to fall back on for mods that only have one or the other.",

        "comment": "making the subject more distinct \u2014 ssilk\nHi,\n\nI know one can shift-left click, shift-right click to copy orders between locomotives; I propose a way of copying orders within the actual order list for the train.\nI love that you can now re-order them and AND / OR operations are far clearer visually. But I'd like to be able to copy them too; for example:\n\nA Coal train.\n1. Load at coal mine to x amount of product\n    Whatever else you want it to check\n    Wait time if you like\n2. Unload at power plant\n    Includes checks of circuit condition and a time delay\n3. Go back to the coal plant (This is the bit I would like to copy from order 1)\n4. Unload some coal at a smelter.\n    Includes checks of circuit condition and a time delay.\n5. Copy the coal loading order order #1 AGAIN\n6. Unload some coal for military science, or another smelter, or a plastics plant. Whatever. The number of stops it feeds in turn may be long or short.\nRepeat orders as usual.\n\nFurther to this, if your coal plant starts to run low, it'd be nice to copy and insert another \"Order 1 - Load Coal\" and \"Order 2 - Service Power Plant\" into the queue, for example between 4 and 5. This would mean more visits to the power plant in between other jobs.\n\nAs it stands one must create the same set of orders for a particular stop over again every time that your train is to visit it.\n\nThoughts?",

Say I'm having problems with a build and ask another person in a multiplayer game to help me. He answers: \"I'm so far away, it will take me hours to get there.\" So I say: \"Go to <coords>\" and I will pick you up with a train.

The last will show a progress computed from the amount present in the train on arrival and the amount currently left in the train. The first two conditions show no progress and only turn green when they are finally met.\n\nMy suggestion is to show the progress for any condition with a count as follows:\n\n on arrival remember the current content of the train\n calculate the difference between the current content and the needed content = delta\n for any condition not already met the progress is: abs(needed - current) / delta\n\n\nThis will work for any condition with a count for both loading and unloading.\n\nNote: On loading the progress will start at 0% even if the train already is partially loaded. I think that is a divergence from current behavior but will show the actual progress made at this station towards the goal.\nWhy ?\nHaving a train schedule open and watching what the train does one can clearly see what is happening when the train is loaded. But on unloading nothing seems to happen unless the \"Empty cargo inventory\" condition is included. Showing a progress for all condition with count would be more constistent and easier to see what is going on when a train is stuck at a station or when simply watching the train.",
