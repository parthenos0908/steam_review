If you like titan fall 2 and want to experience a different side in the arena, I recommend this game. Although I have little hours on pc I have many on console. As I said in the beginning great game!",

        "review": "After clocking in 169 hours on Steam and 192 hours on origin, I feel as if I may comment some thoughts on the game. I've been playing Since it first came out (minus most of Season 3 & 5) and feel as if the game is very fun and consistent in gameplay. Respawn takes time to analyze and act before throwing things out into the open, but they also will lookout for issues that need to be fixed. \n\nThat is not to say that they are perfect, but they do pay attention to feedback. Just recently was an example; Valkyrie has a hover mode on her VTOL passive and can use her Tactical at the same time and compound to reduce fuel usage in the air. Fuel would be consumed at a 1/10th pace and would generally slow down gun fights and make things easier on the Valkyrie by making her a hard to hit bird in the sky. This was quickly assessed and only the hover fuel consumption can benefit Valkyrie now. \n\nAs shown above, Respawn can act quick in changes that need to be made. That does not mean they always act quick. They spend time and research looking into balancing and reworks that overall benefit the meta, characters, and team comps that spawn from the abilities of characters. A rework came with Season 9 that balanced Lifeline in an overall positive stance. It was believed that her passive was too strong whilst her ult and tactical were weak. This was fixed increasing her revive capacity whilst removing the shield and making her care package benefit the overall team more. Along with this change was a Horizon nerf that decreased her pick rate as Horizon was in the meta for very long due to her tactical allowing for ease of escape in battles. Personal example of pickrate: Horizon used to be found in 5 out of 20 teams in the regular trios match. This has now been decreased to about 2 out of 20.\n\nThere are some negatives that come with this game, but not all are the fault of Respawn. Common amongst games now adays are massive server issues that come with new waves of content. When games drop said content, players will rush onto the servers and cause heavy load which only degrades performance altogether. With the launch of Season 9, the servers were awful. It was hard to load into the game and even worse was the packet loss in every match. While the effects are calming down, it is still not uncommon to be unable to find matches and encounter packet loss. Along with server issues are DDoSers that invade ranked matches and will try and hit the match offline for easy RP. I encountered a group DDoSing a bronze match (Rank adjustments for the start of season) just 2 weeks ago. Respawn has been having issues with these DDoSers for a while. Titanfall 1 has been offline for a long time and Titanfall 2 gets hit every now and then. Apex servers are under constant attack on Console and high ranked matches can sometimes be unplayable. Respawn is not a god that can fix these server issues instantly but, at the same time, I do not work for them so I can not say how well they are doing. I only know that if these two issues don't get fixed quick, it won't end well for Apex and it's lifespan. The only thing that will happen is that more players will leave and move to new games.",

        "review": "I'd like to preface this review by saying: Apex Legends is a good game. This comes with some serious caveats, which I'll talk about below.\n\nApex Legends was, at one point, a strong candidate to be the best Battle Royale on the market. On its release in 2019, the game was untouchable; it was fast paced, heavily skill dependent, and had solid balance between all the legends in the game that encouraged teams to play aggressively. Over time, however, Respawn spent time adding patches that continually removed content and features that helped with performance or allowed players to express their skill while playing the game. As a result, I can't in good conscience recommend getting into Apex Legends if you weren't already a player prior to these updates.\n\nThe major issues I have with Apex currently vs. on release:\n-Removal of most console commands that allowed better framerate\n-Removal of bunny-hop healing\n-Enforced cross-play\n-Buffs to stationary, defensive agents (Caustic, Wattson, etc.)\n-Map selection (King's Canyon S1 >>>>)\n\nSome of these decisions will probably never be walked back on (bhop healing and buffs to defensive agents in particular) and as a result I've gone back to other BRs, notably Fortnite, instead.",
